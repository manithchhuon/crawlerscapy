Crime,FEATURED,Latest,Tourism;Phnom Penh: Two British tourists James Donahue and Josh Little were taken away by immigration police on Tuesday 9 April, for being drunk and generally upsetting the general public*.------After being put in a makeshift drunk tank for around 10 hours to sober up, both men wrote a formal letter of apology and signed an official contract promising not to get up to any more trouble during their stay in Cambodia.------With lessons hopefully learned, both men were later released without charge.------All visitors to the Kingdom of Cambodia are reminded to behave in a respectful manner and not to break the laws of the country.------*It later transpired that the pair had been fighting in the street, not paying for transport and even tried to gain access to the Turkish embassy, so are very lucky lads to have got off so lightly.
