These can last about 3-4 years if made properly.------Grass around the tree should be cleared in order to collect the droppings easily. The poop should be collected in early afternoon, to allow time to dry and be stored in a dark, cool environment. Well prepared do-dos fetch around $4/kg.------Mixed with cow manure, bat guano can be a natural fertilizer for many crops.------
