Top Runner (CNTR) is a competition organised by Phnom Penh Athletics Club
(PPAC) to find out who is the best runner in Cambodia, combining long distance
fitness, sprint speed and power, and middle-distance speed-endurance – and most
importantly who has the dedication and commitment to turn up and complete the
whole series of races.------Our novel idea is to challenge all the runners over every track distance – to compare sprinters with long distance runners – in a single competition.------PPAC was founded
by and is managed by UK entrepreneurs/sports enthusiasts Martin Kendrik and
Neil Bianchi, to facilitate CNTR and other sports events.------In the first
competition of its kind, the 2020 edition of CNTR started in the first week of
January. The competition is divided into eight race events held on Sunday
mornings at different venues around Phnom Penh. Road races are held away from
the city traffic around the Sokha loop at Chruoy Changvar while track events
take place at the Olympic stadium athletics track. If successful, the format
could be repeated in the following years.------CNTR 2020 was
open to Cambodian locals and foreigners of all ages, however, most of the
competitors were invited to take part based on their previous performances.------Competitors race over 8 events in Phnom Penh,
ranging from a 100m sprint to a 10km road race. Points will be awarded based on
performance in each race, the athlete with the highest total points over all
races will be declared Cambodia’s Top Runner 2020.------Each event has a
time-cap (based on internationally recognised standards) that must be met to
score full points. Time requirements are needed to uphold a minimum standard
for an elite national competition, separating it from mass participation
events.------The winner of
each race will be awarded 1,000 points, and the last athlete who completes the
race within the time-cap will receive 200 points. All the finishers in between
get their respective points. Athletes who fail to finish within the time-cap
will gain 1-199 points depending on the results.------One of the major
reasons for the format of the competition was to identify which top athletes
also had the motivation and dedication to turn up and complete each event week
in, week out. A major component of making it as an elite runner is to be
dedicated to consistent training and regular competition. This is a highly
important factor for potential sponsors of top athletes.------The idea for the competition originated from
discussions about organising regular competitive time trials to test athletes’
progress. While simple time trials are easy to operate with one or two
organisers, the more elaborate CNTR competition was not possible to organise
without the assistance of the local athletes who have connections to the elite
running community. To help with this we work with the top national athletes.
The strategic planning of the competition is done by Martin and Neil with
additional coordination from top-level athletes Meyjou Heng and Bunthorn Chhun
(who both represented Cambodia in the 2019 SEA Games) to help with the
Cambodian community. There are a number of other volunteers who help out at
each event on the day.------The idea was to
create a higher level competition for the country’s top runners. There are
currently very few races and it is felt that most are not designed, or
suitable, for high performance competitive athletics and focus on mass
participation. In contrast to this we focus rigorously on operating with
competition conditions: accurate race distance measurement, electronic timing and
documentation and publication of all results.------Our goals are to
raise the standard of elite level running in Cambodia, provide more races and
more competitive races – especially track events – and raise the profile of the
top runners. The CNTR competition and the objectives of PPAC will go a long way
towards helping Cambodia achieve more success in athletics and related
disciplines.------The success of this competition is very
important for the development of further projects in the future and we believe
this and future similar initiatives are necessary to help put Cambodia on the
road to sporting success in athletics.------We believe the
only way to raise the standard of athletics in Cambodia is to try to create
more serious events to push more athletes to compete and to train harder. By
attempting to promote competitiveness at the highest level we hope more
athletes will take part and push themselves to improve.------So why
should athletes take part in CNTR?------Initially, 33
people registered including 24 Cambodians with several entries from Japan,
Australia, France, UK and the USA. Disappointingly, 16 dropped out before the
first event with 15 still remaining after 4 events. Since starting the
competition many others have turned up and want to get involved which is a
promising sign for future events following the conclusion of CNTR 2020.------On the journey to
finding Cambodia’s best runners, the competition aims to provide a number of
great benefits for the athletes taking part and completing all 8 events:------During this process, we hope to:------We also want to
promote:------Athletics is one
of the most accessible and rewarding sports and is great for building strength,
fitness and coordination, staying healthy, and developing strong discipline.
You don’t need any experience to try out and it requires minimal equipment.------We want more people to get involved. We hope
that giving people the chance to try out competitive athletics on the track and
at short road race distances will encourage more participation and interest in
the future.------The only way to
improve athletics at the elite level is to widen the number of participants at
the base of the pyramid. More athletes must be training effectively and
participating in meaningful competitions on a regular basis to push each other
to the highest level, driving up the standard of those who will potentially
represent Cambodia in future international events.------PPAC
operation philosophy------PPAC provides all
the events for free for all competitors, making it accessible for anyone,
regardless of their economic status, unlike many other races which charge
significant entry fees.------CNTR is a free to
enter competition operated as a not-for-profit community project by PPAC whose
main aim is to help develop elite level athletics in Cambodia.------PPAC and the CNTR
competition currently have no budget, no funding, no sponsorship and no help
from any NGOs and charities. We spend large amounts of time organising the
events, aided entirely by a few dedicated volunteers.------Funding is
urgently required to help continue running the events. Any funding would
improve on the standard set so far, and provide prizes for competitors. Further
details can be found in our sponsorship proposal. Success at this stage will
increase the possibility of creating bigger, better and more competitive events
in the near future and encourage more athletes to take part.------We believe what
we’ve created so far with so few resources is phenomenal but with funding,
we’ll be capable of taking it to the next level.------We want more
like-minded people to get involved and help organise events. We are looking for
timekeepers, photographers, videographers and publicity. If you think you can
assist the competition by volunteering at an event in some form, or are
interested in providing sponsorship, please get in touch.------We have a full
sponsorship proposal document prepared for interested parties, please contact
us for full information.------Everybody can
play their part in raising the profile of Cambodian athletics. Together we can
encourage more people to get involved and help develop the sport of running.
Please share this with your friends and come and test yourself against the
best.------Full information
