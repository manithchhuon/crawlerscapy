Agriculture,Business & Property,FEATURED,Latest;BRUSSELS (Reuters) – European Union countries failed on Tuesday to determine whether to impose tariffs on rice coming from Cambodia and Myanmar from the start of next year to curb a surge in imports, leaving the European Commission to take the final decision.------A majority of EU countries backed the introduction of “safeguard” measures for three years, but not the sufficient “qualified majority” formally required to clear them.------The European Commission, which oversees trade policy for the 28-member European Union, had proposed the measures and would normally still enact them when there is no decisive vote from member states.------“In the absence of an opinion by the committee, the Commission will take a decision on the application of the safeguard measures,” the Commission said in a statement.------The Commission’s proposal was to set a duty of 175 euros ($198.31) per tonne of rice in the first year, dropping to 150 euros in the second and 125 euros in year three, according to people familiar with the plan.------Cambodia and Myanmar benefit from the EU’s “Everything But Arms” scheme that allows the least developed countries to export most goods to the European Union free of duties.------Both countries already face losing their special access to the world’s largest trading bloc over their human rights records, although this potential sanction is separate from the rice safeguard measures.------The Commission opened an investigation into rice imports from the two countries in March following a complaint by Italy.------It found that a significant surge in imports had caused economic damage to the rice sector in Europe. Rice grows in eight southern European countries from Portugal to Bulgaria.------EU farming group Copa-Cogeca says that the two countries’ exports to the European Union of longer-grained Indica rice have increased from 9,000 tonnes in 2012 to 360,000 tonnes in 2017, resulting in a collapse of rice prices.------($1 = 0.8825 euros)------Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; editing by David Evans------https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-eu-trade-rice/eu-tariffs-on-myanmar-cambodia-rice-unclear-after-eu-countries-vote-idUKKBN1O32M6
