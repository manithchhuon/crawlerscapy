FEATURED,Latest,News;Seeing as it’s been a few weeks, we can now give a more detailed report into what really happened on his aborted attempt to find MH370.------Wilson and his brother arrived in ------Kampong Spue------ province with no plan, no experience, a poor choice of equipment and just a few days to achieve their goal. There wasn’t even a supermarket.------After being denied permission from the district authorities, the intrepid pair, with the aid of a local expat (and the advice of his 81 year old father “Take some bananas”), set out to the base of Aural mountain.------There, they met a group of park rangers, who, with some persuasion, agreed to take them to the supposed crash site, but weren’t particularly willing to camp out.------The British duo, unaccustomed to the heat and humidity of the jungle, were weighed down with camping gear, whereas local guides prefer to just sling up a lightweight hammock if caught in the forest at night.------The rangers hacked through the foliage clad in flip-flops, with the minimal of equipment, while the Brits lumbered behind, forgetting to even take any food.------At a river, the source says, the locals skipped across from rock to rock ‘like little birds’, as the pair found the going difficult.------After a few hours, encounters with illegal loggers and a couple of miles in, the boys gave up, returned to the ranger base and were back in Phnom Penh before 10pm the same night.------Now, according to British ‘newspaper’ The Sun, they may have been trolled the whole time.------A tech expert believes that the sighting of the vanished jet on the mapping service may have been the work of online hoaxers------AN image on Google Maps purportedly of missing jet MH370 may have been the work of hackers, a software expert has claimed.------Open University academic Dr Yijun Yu believes what was spotted on the tech giant’s mapping service may have been digitally inserted.------Dr Yu told ------Daily Star Online------: “I know some data signals for an aircraft to network, you might have hackers insert some false flight.------“So even though in open sky you see nothing, someone can insert a digital record into the network and when people search, they will see an airplane passing by, even though it wasn’t there.------“So the challenge is whether Google’s satellite data was distorted at all.------“It is hard to tell what’s really happened. But that’s one possible explanation, if it’s real then all the other explanations were wrong.”------Dr Yu believes this is the most likely explanation, but has called for a drone to be sent to the spot after claiming the alternative theory could not yet be ruled out.------The plane in Google Maps measures around 70metres in length, a little larger than------MH370’s------ 63.7m but with a mysterious gap between the tail and body.------Daniel Boyer previously claimed to have found ------the cockpit and tail------, complete with Malaysia Airlines logo, of the missing aircraft.------Boyer said that the measurements of the blurry image matched those of the engine perfectly, being 4.3m wide and 2.7m in length.------Boyer’s discovery built off the work of Brit Ian Wilson, who first found what he thinks is an image of the plane on Google Maps.------MH370 took off from Malaysia’s capital Kuala Lumpur for China’s capital Beijing with 239 people on board.------Boyer’s “crash site” is 10 miles away from Wilson’s.------He previously claimed he could make out the aircraft’s cockpit and tail in the grainy pics.------Boyer claims he can make out the cockpit and tail in the grainy images------The photos show several white objects lying on the forest floor north-west of Cambodia’s capital Phnom Penh.------In Boyer’s previous interview he told the ------Daily Star------ one piece measures 17.8ft – close to the 19ft 3in of a Boeing 777 cockpit, leaving him “convinced” this was the front of the plane.------Previously he insisted he can see the red outline of Malaysia Airlines’ logo on another piece, which he said must be the tail.------The piece apparently measures 31.7ft – whereas a tail piece normally measures 30ft.------Boyer told the website: “I couldn’t believe it when I made the sighting.------“First the cockpit can be seen, and now this.------“The debris definitely needs to be investigated.”------The first images of the jet, which vanished on March 8, 2014, were found after video producer Ian Wilson ------spent “hours” searching online------.------Images from Google Maps showed the outline of a large plane in a remote part of southern Cambodia  – which could simply be an aircraft flying directly below the satellite which photographed it.------But Google Earth’s copyright date and imagery date for the picture have been listed as different years in recent weeks, reports ------The Daily Star------.------This has led to speculation the supposed wreckage has been snapped several times in the past by the tech giant’s satellites – ruling out the theory that Wilson’s picture shows a plane in flight.------While the current imagery date is listed as March 2017, last week it was reportedly published as December 2015.------Investigators for the missing Malaysian flight MH370 say they cannot exclude possibility of ‘unlawful interference by a third party’ after releasing the final report------It has also been claimed the outline of the plane was spotted in May, 2014, using Google Maps – just two months after the jet vanished.------Wilson believes this adds further credence to his theory and says he plans to visit the site with his brother – in a bid to capture the £53million finder’s fee.------He told the Star: “After much discussion last night, we’re just organising final vaccinations and the hiring of guides.”------But aviation expert Yijun Yu puts the imagery date mystery down to either a system glitch or that Google hasn’t updated its pictures for the spot.------Flight 370 ------disappeared on March 8, 2014------, en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing with 239 people on board.------Just 38 minutes into the flight, ------MH370------ lost contact with Malaysia Airlines.------The plane was never found despite a search that cost millions and lasted for years.------Various theories------ – some more viable than others – emerged to explain what happened to the plane.------Other than the Cambodian jungle theory, these include the “suicidal” pilot deliberately crashing into the sea, the aircraft being shot down by North Korea and a conspiracy to bring down the Malaysian government.------The Sun
