Latest,Social;by ------Andreas Wiseman------September 5, 2018 2:46am------Osborne and Ben Cookson (------Waiting For Anya------) will adapt the novel for screen. Producers on the feature will be Bad Penny’s Phin Glynn (------Mad To Be Normal------) and Daz Spencer Lovesey (------Waiting for Anya------).------The novel takes place in modern day Cambodia and sees an English teacher, Robert Grieve, win a satchel’s worth of money and decide to take a journey deeper into the wilder side of the country. Coming up against a scheming American, a crooked police officer and a darker side of Cambodia, Grieve follows his journey to a dramatic climax.------The film will be executive-produced by Norman Merry (------The Nice Guys------) and in association with post-production house Lipsync. Local production in Cambodia will be facilitated by Nicholas Simon (------A Prayer Before Dawn------) and IndoChina Productions. The deal was negotiated on Osborne’s behalf by Adam Eaglin at The Cheney Agency.------Osborne’s currently has a number of novels in development, including ------The Forgiven------, ------which is being adapted by John Michael McDonagh and is set to star Ralph Fiennes, Mark Strong and Rebecca Hall, and ------Beautiful Animals------, which has been set up at Amazon with John Lesher producing.------Osborne said of his latest option, “I knew as soon as I met the Bad Penny team that I had found the right people to adapt ------Hunters In The Dark------ to the screen. A novel is a very intimate and interior thing, but it is always intriguing to see how it might be developed in a different medium. As a co-writer on the adaptation, however, I feel even more confident that this version will be the one that does my book full justice.”------https://deadline.com/2018/09/bad-penny-productions-options-cambodia-thriller-novel-hunters-in-the-dark-lawrence-osborne-1202457327/
