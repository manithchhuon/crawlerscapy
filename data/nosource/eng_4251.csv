FEATURED,Latest,News;PHNOM PENH: Everyone did well from Nary’s marriage to a Chinese man, except the young Cambodian bride herself, who returned home from the six-year ordeal destitute, humiliated and with little prospect of seeing her son again.------Her brother ran away with US$3,000 after cajoling the then 17-year-old to leave Cambodia to marry. Brokers split the remaining US$7,000 paid by her Chinese husband, who got himself a longed-for heir.------But her wedding to a stranger thousands of miles from home, in a language she could not understand, was ill-fated from the start.------“It was not a special day for me,” Nary told AFP.------She is one of tens of thousands of young Cambodian, Vietnamese, Laos and Myanmar women – and girls – who marry Chinese men each year, plugging a gender gap incubated by Beijing’s three-decade-long one-child policy.------While the policy has ended, a shortfall of around 33 million women has left the same number of men facing life on the shelf.------Poverty drives many women from the Mekong region to gamble on marriage in China, double-locked by low education levels and a social expectation to provide for parents.------Others move for work but end up forced into marriage. The worst cases involve kidnapping and trafficking across porous borders.------There are happy marriages, with women also able to provide for the poor villages they left behind.------But new domestic realities frequently unravel, leaving women at risk of abuse, detention under Chinese immigration law or ‘resale’ into prostitution.------Nary – whose name has been changed on her request – spoke to a Cambodian marriage broker on her older brother’s advice.------“I trusted him,” Nary said in a whisper, as rain drove through holes in the tin roof of her family’s roadside shack outside Phnom Penh.------“My family is poor and I was expected to help them by marrying a Chinese man. So I went.”------But her brother stole the dowry that was meant to help the whole family and has since vanished.------LIES AND POVERTY------Buying a wife in China costs between US$10,000 and US$15,000, a sum paid to brokers who give a couple of thousand to overseas associates for recruiting the brides.------A dowry of between US$1,000 and US$3,000 is dangled in front of the bride’s family, while the young woman herself is last in the money chain, if she receives anything at all.------“Families are now looking to their daughters to see the ‘interest’ they can return to them,” says Chou Bun Eng, vice-chair of Cambodia’s National Committee for Counter Trafficking, referring to the money motive that prevails in some homes.------The marriage trade is big business – official figures say 10,000 Cambodian women alone are registered in the southern provinces of Guangdong, Guizhou and Yunnan.------Brides are often ‘warehoused’ on arrival and their photos touted on WeChat and dating websites to would-be husbands.------The younger and prettier they are, the more expensive.------Nary travelled legally on a tourist visa to China but on arrival in Shanghai, she discovered the man who paid for her hand was a construction worker living in a village, not the “wealthy doctor” she had been promised.------Tens of thousands of women from Mekong countries travel each year to marry Chinese husbands, plugging a gender gap incubated by Beijing’s three decade-long one-child policy.
