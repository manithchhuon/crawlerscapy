There are fears that foreigners could take these livlihoods from locals.------According to the latest economic census in Cambodia. There are a total of 5,500,134 commercial organizations across the country, of which nearly 80% are self-employed or only have one employee, 10% of commercial organizations have less than 10 emplyees.------There are only 786 companies with more than 100 employees and only 119 companies with more than 1,000 employees.------The order issued by the Ministry of Labor has also caused problems for some local companies and foreign employers, especially for service industries, as it is often difficult to hire local employees who meet the service requirements.
