FEATURED,Latest,News;A CNE contributor has sent us a report on the water situation in some parts of Sihanoukville. Apparently there isn’t any, and hasn’t been for the past 9 days.------According to the source, who wishes to remain anonymous, the area around Kamakor Street, specifically around the Yabo Casino, has been without H2O since 22------nd------ October.------The pipes dried up after work was done to improve the drainage system, which was obviously effective as there is now no water to drain.------Water officials have been made aware of the problem, but nothing, as yet, seems to be happening to reconnect the neighborhood back to the supply.------Fed up residents have resorted to buying in clean water, at a cost of $50 for 6 cubic meters, and are understandably not happy with having to do so.
