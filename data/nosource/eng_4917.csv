The hospital can’t give him the expert care he needs and our only option is to get him home without delay.------“I do not expect the Government to pay my bills, I asked for a loan that I will repay.------“I’ve applied to remortgage my house and this process doesn’t happen overnight. The Government are aware of this. Once the remortgage is through, I can pay every penny back.------“I’ve been denied an emergency loan three times now and want to know why the Government are refusing to help a tax-paying family affected by an overseas crisis?------“He’s my only son and I just want to get him back to give him a fighting chance.”------Charles was found unconscious in a flat in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh on September 6.------He is unable to speak or breathe unaided and can only communicate using his eyelids.------Esther flew to south-east Asia to keep a vigil by her son’s hospital bed.------Her daughters Jennifer and Lyndsay have set up an online appeal to try to raise the cash needed to fly their brother home.------Jennifer, 42, said: “Charles is being left to die out there. We are all in bits and just want him flown back.------“Neurologically, the hospital can’t give him the care he needs. If we don’t get him home, then he won’t make it.------“It’s breaking our hearts knowing he’s stuck out there helpless.”------Charles, originally from Gourock, Renfrewshire, decided to go travelling last November after being made redundant from his advisory role with HSBC in London.------He went to Cambodia with his girlfriend but decided to extend his stay while she returned home.------However, his travel insurance had run out and he is not covered for medical expenses.------Charles had been staying in cheap rental accommodation.------He became friends with his landlord, who grew concerned when he hadn’t heard from Charles for a few days. He let himself into the apartment and found the Scot unconscious on the floor.------Charles’s family are having to stump up £300 a night for hospital costs but staff are unable to offer him the expert care he would receive on the NHS.------Jennifer said: “We’ve exhausted all of our options fundraising to get him home. At what point do the Government recognise this?------“We are a standard family just like any other, yet the British Government expect us to deal with a highly complicated and extremely serious medical emergency 6280 miles away all on our own.------“All scans, treatments, ambulance trips and everything that’s been done is going to come right out of our own pocket. We’ve had no support.”------The Foreign Office’s website states: “In some situations, and only when all other options have been exhausted, we can pay some costs or fees on your behalf – for example, travel costs, travel documents, cash advances, charter flight costs – when you agree to sign an Undertaking to Repay form, which we will provide for you.”------Last night, a Foreign Office spokesman said: “Our thoughts are with Charlie’s family at this extremely difficult time.------“While our staff continue to do all they can to support them, the FCO are not funded to provide financial assistance to British people overseas.------“In exceptional circumstances, we can provide a small emergency loan to help someone return to the UK. These loans are for a one-way economy airfare and cannot be used to cover the costs of medical repatriation, or to pay medical bills.------West of Scotland Labour MSP Neil Bibby said: “It is absolutely vital that the Foreign Office step up to help bring Charles home. This could be a matter of life and death.------“Charles’s family have already done wonders to raise over £40,000 from the generosity and kindness of thousands of people. All they are now asking for is assistance from the Foreign Office in order to get them over the line.------“Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt needs to urgently intervene and support the family’s efforts to help bring Charles back to the UK.”------https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-mum-says-stroke-victim-13269643?_ga=2.132216846.1671819807.1537358301-1010579337.1537358301
