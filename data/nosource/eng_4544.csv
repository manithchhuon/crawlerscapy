FEATURED,Latest,News;Tom Steinmetz, who was recently brought before court on charges of defamation by an ex-girlfriend, before being released without charge, has contacted CNE with a statement:------It’s important to further clear that the case has been dismissed by dropping the charges on both sides.------Sometimes in life there are misunderstandings which can lead to difficult and awkward situations. It is not about being right, nor is it about being smart, it’s just about recognizing the misunderstanding and being able to move forward in an adult and dignified manner.------I would like it to be known that Miss Nhoem Sokleng and I have reached mutual agreement over recent misunderstandings. I have agreed to drop all complaints and actions against Miss Nhoem Sokleng, and she has agreed to drop all complaints and actions against me.------Now is not the time to dig in the past and get caught in a cycle of who did what to whom, but I hope that Miss Nhoem Sokleng will be kind enough to further retract her claims regarding me posting any items of a sexual nature or indeed inflicting any violence on her, as these are both untrue and extremely hurtful. I have never posted sexual material featuring Miss Nhoem Sokleng, nor have I been violent towards her or anyone else.------I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologies that our short romance led to such bitterness and misunderstandings. It is hard to explain how much pain and upset these events have caused myself and my amazing Khmer family – who I will thank here for their unwavering support – and I am sure that Miss Nhoem Sokleng will agree with me in hoping that this statement sees the end of the matter and that we can both return to normal lives.------I would also like to express my gratitude to the court for allowing both parties to reach a mutual understanding without recourse to further and ongoing legal action, and I would also like to thank those people close to me who offered unequivocal and unconditional support throughout this harrowing ordeal.
