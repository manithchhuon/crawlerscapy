Crime,FEATURED,Latest,News;A DOCTOR who paid for sex with girls as young as nine has been jailed for five years in Cambodia.------Clive Cressy, 70, from Hove, was found with a sickening suitcase full of Barbie dolls, tiny dresses and girls’ shoes, mixed in with his collection of condoms and lubricant.------The physician was arrested at his apartment in Cambodia’s capital Phnom Penh along with his Vietnamese wife, 27, who procured vulnerable youngsters for him.------He was found guilty at a court in the city on Thursday, where prosecutors said he had paid up to $3,000 – £2,400 – to his victims to have “unlimited sex” whenever he wanted.------The girls he preyed on lived with Cressy and his wife and were aged between nine and 13, the court was told.------Prosecutors said Cressy had moved to Cambodia in 2015 before starting a job as an English literature teacher at a private school.------He claimed that he and his wife Chea Sokthy, 27, “adopted” the four young Vietnamese girls, all from poor rural families, to educate them and give them a better life.------But while living at their apartment, Cressy paid each victim to “have sex with them any time he wanted” while his wife received $1,000 – £790 – for each girl she recruited.------Police rescued the four traumatised girls from the Phnom Penh apartment when it was raided and Cressy arrested on April 27, 2017.------Cressy’s wife initially went on the run but was re-arrested in June this year. She denied any knowledge of his actions but was found guilty.------Presiding Judge Thlang Phaneth jailed Cressy for five years but the victims might appeal what their lawyers regard as a light sentence.------Judge Phaneth said: “The court has jailed each of the suspects for five years. They will be deported from Cambodia after they are released.------“Clive Cressy is guilty of the purchase of child prostitution and Chea Sokthy is guilty of soliciting child prostitution.------“He paid his young victims between $2,000 and $3,000 to allow him to have sex at whatever time he felt like it.’’------The two defendants must also pay a total of $12,000 in compensation, which will be split between the four victims.------Welcoming the guilty verdict, prosecutor Sorn Sony branded Cressy a predator who had deliberately targeted the young girls.------But Mrs Sony said the sentence of five years was too light.------She said: “I laud the court’s verdict.------“But I think the sentence is too light and does not fit the crime.------“I do not know whether my clients will accept the sentence or will appeal for a heavier one.”------https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/17300049.doctor-70-jailed-for-paying-girls-as-young-as-nine-for-sex-in-cambodia/
