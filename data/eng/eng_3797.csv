Environment,FEATURED,Latest,News;Edinburgh Zoo have released adorable footage showing a rare Malayan sun bear playing with his mate.------Rotana was rescued from a private home in Cambodia where he was being kept in a tiny cage as a status symbol, a fate common to many of these unusual small bears.------After being rescued, Rotana was rehomed by the zoo in 2010 along with his brother Somnang in partnership with animal charity ------Free The Bears------ , who work to conserve bear species across Asia.------Somnang has since moved to Burgers Zoo in the Netherlands as he’s been matched with a female there in a conservation breeding programme.------However, Rotana stayed in the capital and was recently joined by a four-year-old female bear called Babu. There’s hope that the pair will be compatible after footage showed them playing together when they took their first steps outside together last week.------Alison MacLean, team leader for carnivores at ------Edinburgh Zoo------ , said: “It is wonderful to see Rotana and Babu getting on so well.------Sun bears in Cambodia are snared before being butchered and served as bear paw soup.------They’re also kept in battery farms: trapped in tiny cages to harvest their bile, which is used in traditional medicine.------Some are caught from the wild and kept as exotic pets or status symbols.------Many are also kept in cages in hotels for the amusement of guests and tourists.------They’re also under threat due to the rapid destruction of their habitat, which is logged for hard timber products------“Sun bear numbers are rapidly declining in the wild due to deforestation and poaching, so our new couple have an important role to play in the European conservation breeding programme.”------Malayan sun bears are one of the world’s rarest species of bear, with numbers continuing to decline across Asia.------Edinburgh Live
