Environment,Latest;About 4 weeks ago the Wildlife Alliance in Cambodia received a 14 year old mother long tailed macaque monkey, she was named Amari.  Along with Amari was her 10 month old severely injured baby Lori. This is their story….------Amari and Lori spent countless hours being videotaped by locals at the famous ------Angkor Wat Temple------ in Cambodia, for YouTube viewers across the world.  About a month-and-a-half ago viewers started noticing that Amari appeared to be having vision problems.  People were coming to the conclusion that she could possibly have diabetes and be suffering from diabetic induced retinopathy.------Lori since her birth has managed to suffer many terrible accidents.  A few months back Lori suffered her first traumatic brain injury.  She was treated by some well-intended people there in the area.  And in about a week’s time she was finally released and reunited with her mother Amari. This final accident that the two suffered was not so forgiving. Amari has been the matriarch  macaque in her troupe of monkeys for many years,  when another troupe of monkeys attempted to invade, they chased her up a high temple wall approximately 25 feet and attacked her. In the process with her partial blindness, she managed to have her ear torn apart.------She then went to go seek out her baby Lori who was hiding.  When she finally  found baby Lori, the both attempted to quickly climb back down the wall to escape the invading troupe. That was when Amari took a fall from approximately 25 feet and landed with baby Lori attached to her.  Baby Lori suffered significant brain injuries and spinal injuries, along with a broken leg.------Also a couple days prior, her tail had been ran over by a car. She was in so much pain, at times it was difficult to watch.  The injuries were so severe that people contacted the WLA to come and rescue the girls from the situation. The WLA drove 600 miles to retrieve them and bring them to their Rehabilitation and Sanctuary.------Lori after a month of being at the sanctuary,  has made an amazing recovery.  Her brain injury also caused her some temporary blindness, that the WLA is seeing significant progress in daily, as she continues to recover from her head injury. The rest of her injuries are healing very well and she is up and starting to walk and communicate again. This has overjoyed thousands of people who have tuned into the WLA to receive updates on both of the girls progress.------Amari due to her blindness unfortunately being caused from diabetes, the WLA doesn’t seem to have very much hope for her regaining much of her sight. The WLA however has switched her diet to something more suitable for a macaque with diabetes. Many of their different uploaded Youtube videos may still be seen.------The WLA also maintains a YouTube channel from their zookeeper. The name of the channel is Sitheng Try.  Many people have been tuning in there for current updates.  Amari and Lori have not been able to be together at the sanctuary due to the need of a suitable structure being built for a blind mother macaque, that will also accommodate her handicapped daughter as well. So it is our mission at this point to try and raise funds for the WLA, which is a non-profit organization that rescues wildlife not only in Cambodia, but across Asia as well.------All donations for these two beautiful animals who have sacrificed so much for our pleasure, will be going directly to the WLA. They will not be going into a private account for the people hosting this GoFundMe project.------More information that anyone is interested in on the WLA can be found on the Wild Life Alliance Facebook page. Thank you for your understanding, generosity and support of these two lovely animals.------Go Fund Me
