FEATURED,Latest,Sport;The AFC U-23 Championship 2020 Qualifiers campaign ended even stevens as far as Cambodia and Chinese Taipei were concerned as the two teams played out a 1-1 draw. ------Cambodia began the game well and could have taken the lead early, but a lack of incisiveness in the final third let their team down.------Nonetheless, backed by Japan legend Keisuke Honda on the touchline, Cambodia pushed on to try and find a goal, and went close when a corner from the far side deflected off the crossbar. Unfortunately, nobody was alert enough or alive enough to tap in the rebound for the Cambodians.------It prompted a response from Chinese Taipei, who immediately replied with a few warning shots of their own, but the real threat was at the other end in an open first half.------The deadlock was broken by Sin Kakada for Cambodia as his sublime left foot was on display again following a neat pass played into him. The youngster aimed and struck beautifully, giving the goalkeeper no chance of stopping his effort. 1-0 to Cambodia.------It ended 1-0 to Cambodia at the half-time whistle, but the second half brought with it renewed optimism as far as Chinese Taipei were concerned.------They didn’t waste too much time in getting on the opposition’s back, and a set piece proved Cambodia’s undoing as a free kick whipped in from the near side proved too hot to handle. Following a teammate’s touch, Philip Ponder had the simple task of nodding the ball into an empty net and send the Cambodian fans at the Phnom Penh Olympic Stadium into shock.------With the game now 1-1, substitutions became the name of the game, but neither side was able to grab the initiative despite Ponder having a golden opportunity to steal the win for his side at the death.------Cambodia mustered one final chance in stoppage time, but it proved too little too late for them as their Qualifying campaign ended rather meekly with this 1-1 draw.------Fox Sport Asia
