FEATURED,Latest,News;AN MH370 sleuth claims he is teaming up with an elite squad of jungle troops in a bid to track down the wreckage of the doomed flight.------Brit Ian Wilson will reportedly join forces with Cambodian soldiers on a mission through mountains to the north west of Phnom Penh.------Wilson, from Camden, London,------ says his brother Jackie will join him on the adventure to find the missing Boeing 777-200 he believes he has located on Google Maps.------He told------ Daily Star Online------: “I’m excited. A real worry was not having anyone skilled taking us in, and going in on our own.------“But I’ll leave it to the experts. They seem really helpful at the moment. I think we’ll get as close as we can before we start climbing.”------He is set to fly out from London’s Heathrow Airport on Tuesday in an ambitious attempt to solve an aviation mystery which has spawned dozens of conspiracy theories.------Yesterday it was reported how a  second “crash site” has also been spotted in Cambodia by fellow part-time plane-hunter Daniel Boyer.------He claims he can make out the missing Malaysia Airlines plane’s cockpit and tail in the grainy pics.------The photos show several white objects lying on the forest floor north-west of the Cambodian capital.------Boyer told the ------Daily Star------ one piece measures 17.8ft – close to the 19ft 3in of a Boeing 777 cockpit, leaving him “convinced” this was the front of the plane.------And he insisted he can see the red outline of Malaysia Airlines’ logo on another piece, which he said must be the tail.------The piece apparently measures 31.7ft – whereas a tail piece normally measures 30ft.------Mr Boyer told the website: “I couldn’t believe it when I made the sighting.------“First the cockpit can be seen, and now this. The debris definitely needs to be investigated.”------The first images of the jet, which vanished on March 8, 2014, were found after video producer Wilson ------spent “hours” searching online------.------Images from Google Maps showed the outline of a large plane in a remote part of southern Cambodia  – which could simply be an aircraft flying directly below the satellite which photographed it.------But Google Earth’s copyright date and imagery date for the picture have been listed as different years in recent weeks, reports ------The Daily Star------.------This has led to speculation the supposed wreckage has been snapped several times in the past by the tech giant’s satellites – ruling out the theory that Wilson’s picture shows a plane in flight.------While the current imagery date is listed as March 2017, last week it was reportedly published as December 2015.------https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7490434/mh370-sleuth-soldiers-search-cambodian-jungle-plane-wreckage/
