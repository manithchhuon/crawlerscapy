Environment,FEATURED,Latest;The Cardamom Rainforest Landscape forms part of a global biodiversity hotspot and hosts over 50 IUCN threatened species. Because it is so rich with biodiversity, it is a source for the wildlife trade and attracts outside hunters. Wildlife Alliance rangers from the ------Green Peafowl station------ (Sre Ambel) set up a vehicle checkpoint on a road leading out of the protected area. On January 20, a suspect on a motorbike failed to stop for the military police officer and a chase ensued. Without stopping, the suspect dropped a bag clearly containing wildlife. The ranger collected the bag and found a live mousedeer (or chevrotain), the smallest ungulate in the world, inside.------The ------lesser oriental chevrotain------ (------Tragulus kanchil------) is the smallest ungulate in the world and the most widespread mousedeer species in Southeast Asia and the only mousedeer species in the Cardamom Rainforest Landscape (------Gray 2018------). Although they are not threatened with extinction, they are widely hunted for their meat, a fate narrowly escaped by this mousedeer thanks to Wildlife Alliance’s ranger force. The mousedeer was unharmed, so the rangers immediately released it back into the wild.------From ------Wildlife Alliance
