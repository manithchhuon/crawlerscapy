FEATURED,Health;THE condition of a York father who was left in a coma after suffering serious head injuries in a scooter crash in Cambodia is continuing to improve.------ ------Joe Quarcoo-Morrissey ’s assessment on a coma scale of 1-15 has risen from a very low score of just three out of 15 – with him only having a 30 per cent chance of survival – to a highest possible ranking of 15 out of 15, said his father Kevin.------However, he said Joe remained in intensive care in a Cambodian hospital, at a cost of £3,000 a week, without insurance cover to meet the bills.------A £50,000 appeal which was launched less than a fortnight ago to help pay the hospital’s fees is now approaching the £20,000 milestone, with the appeal total reaching £19,333 by yesterday afternoon.------The Press revealed last week how Joe, 24, a former York Steiner School and All Saints School pupil from the ------Fulford------Road area, had suffered the accident in early February.------His family said then that he appeared to have regained consciousness but remained in a seriously ill condition, and the next stage would be critical to his recovery.------Joe has been living with his partner Emilie in Cambodia, where they run a hostel, and they have a baby Saul.------His mother Ernestina happened to be out in Cambodia visiting at the time of the accident, helping Joe and Emilie after Saul was born.------She has now been joined out there by Joe’s sister Rhianna, and his father Kevin is planning to fly out next week.------Kevin has spoken previously of the shock of hearing about his son’s accident, saying: “It’s so emotional and physical – I could barely speak about anything for a week, although I was thinking about it 100 per cent of the time, when I was awake and when I was asleep.”------The appeal was launched by a York friend of Joe, Dan Lucas, who has described him as “an absolutely great guy… really happy-go-lucky, super-kind and thoughtful”.------He said Joe had brought his baby to the UK at Christmas and it had been amazing to see how proud he was of his little boy.------Donations to the appeal can be made by going to www.gofundme.com/f/uc3gj-dough-for-joe.------http://www.gofundme.com/f/uc3gj-dough-for-joe.------By ------Mike Laycock------York Press
