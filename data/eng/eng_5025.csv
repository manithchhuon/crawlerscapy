He took the ordnance from under his house where he had kept it and invited her to sit down.------The woman was justifiably afraid of the B.40 rocket, and ran away to her neighbour’s house to ask for help in stopping her husband from playing with the bomb. Before villagers could arrive, there was an explosion.------The victim was then sent to a hospital in Reaksmey Kham district to be treated by a medical team.------https://tvfb.news/article/14012------More graphic images:------https://nokorthom.com/2018/09/%E1%9E%94%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%8F%E1%9E%B8%E1%9E%85%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%93%E1%9F%83%E1%9E%80%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%94%E1%9E%B6%E1%9E%9B%E1%9E%82%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%9A%E1%9E%B6%E1%9E%94%E1%9F%8B%E1%9E%81%E1%9E%BB%E1%9E%9F/
