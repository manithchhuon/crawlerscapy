Agriculture,Business & Property,FEATURED,Latest;Brian Dicks is running in Humber-Bay of Islands for the Liberals in the May 16 provincial election. Seven years ago, Dicks was president of a short-lived penny stock startup that wanted to grow stevia in Cambodia.------A Liberal candidate in the Newfoundland and Labrador election was president of a Nevada-registered penny-stock company that never made a dime from its plans to grow stevia plants in Cambodia, and saw tens of millions of dollars in market value evaporate nearly as quickly as it appeared.------“I feel that my role with Stevia Nutra was totally above board,” Brian Dicks said in an interview with CBC News.------“It was solid, my performance was solid. I did what was required of me, in my role, to support the company moving forward. So I see nothing in my role with this company that would in any way impact negatively on my ability to move forward in a role with the province.”------Dicks — who is now running to represent Humber-Bay of Islands in the May 16 provincial election — became president of Stevia Nutra in January 2012.------Stevia Nutra was not implicated in any legal or regulatory entanglements during its brief existence.------But the company had business links to a lawyer and financier who would go on to be accused of stock market violations in the U.S. for their work with other penny stock firms around the same time frame.------I see nothing in my role with this company that would in any way impact negatively on my ability to move forward in a role with the province.- Brian Dicks------Stevia Nutra was also touted by a promoter who was later arrested by the FBI on unrelated charges of securities fraud.------Dicks said he and the company had nothing to do with the promotional effort for Stevia Nutra, which suggested the company’s share price “could return you a quick 341%!”------And Dicks said the authorities have never come calling about his time as president of Stevia Nutra.------“There’s been never anything untoward, or any issues raised around the company, or my involvement with it,” he said.------“None.”------Liberal Leader Dwight Ball told reporters this is a non-issue.------“There’s nothing there,” Ball said during a campaign stop in Corner Brook Tuesday. ------“Really, this is an example of a business that wasn’t successful, a business that ran out of money, and in the end, it closed. So that is really the story here, that happened. No wrongdoing at all.”------Dicks told CBC News his involvement with Stevia Nutra began when he was asked to take a look at a business idea in late 2011.------“It was essentially a development stage agro-company that would see us establishing farming operations in Cambodia to cultivate the natural sweetener stevia,” he said.------Dicks said his research showed “growing global demand for the product and it was a tremendous upside potential for companies that were engaged in growing it.”------The company that would become Stevia Nutra was incorporated in Nevada in 2010, and was called AAA Best Car Rental Inc.------AAA Best Car Rental Inc. was based in Paterson, N.J., about a half-hour drive from Manhattan.------It planned to offer discounted car rental services, by acquiring late-model vehicles from used car auctions.------But that idea never got rolling.------On Jan. 4, 2012, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company “underwent a change of control and a change in management.”------In a reverse takeover, Dicks became president, and a Newfoundland and Labrador-registered company he controlled became a shareholder of the newly rechristened Stevia Nutra.------Stevia Nutra’s business address was a residential duplex in Corner Brook.------Two months later, Stevia Nutra reported reaching a deal, through a subsidiary, to lease 20 hectares of land in Cambodia for growing stevia.------Full story: ------https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/brian-dicks-stevia-nutra-penny-stock-1.5124549
