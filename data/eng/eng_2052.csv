Crime,FEATURED,Health,Latest;MANCHESTER (New Hampshire, USA) — A Cambodian sex-trafficking survivor whose captor chopped off her left hand couldn’t contain her smile as she was fitted with a prosthetic Monday at Next Step Bionics and Prosthetics.------“I was just trying to live. This is just really amazing. This is an amazing gift,” the woman, identified as “Nora,” said through a translator. “I didn’t even think it was possible.”------Next Step Bionics and Prosthetics agreed to provide the prosthetic hand free of charge after learning of the horrific attack that left her clinging to life in a Cambodian hospital nearly eight months ago.------Nora still bears the scars — emotional and physical — from her ordeal on Feb. 27, when her assailant chopped off her left hand at the wrist. Her right hand has a scar that spans several inches where the blade of a butcher knife came down as she tried to protect the back of her head. She was also doused with battery acid, which left her with chemical burns on her face and neck.------Doctors at a Cambodian hospital left her with a stump just below her left elbow. Nora eventually moved into a women’s home run by All Things Possible Ministries, an American faith-based organization that set about getting her a prosthetic.------Full Story: ------NHUNIONLEADER
