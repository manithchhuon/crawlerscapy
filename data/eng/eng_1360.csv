Twice, last year, the weight of the 10 kg pig was only $ 100 or $ 120, but this year the same size goes for $ 200 or more.”------A trader stated that he did not know why, but there were fewer pigs and more orders, and the price always goes up when pigs are scarce. ------KPT------*Worth noting that African Swine Fever (ASF) badly effected the pig farming trade in China, Vietnam and some parts of Cambodia in 2019.
