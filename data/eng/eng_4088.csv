------At 12.10 am on 27th December 2018, Mario Maehlmyer, a long term German expat was ------viciously assaulted------ by three foreign men in front of Drynk Bar in Siem Reap Town.------Mario spoke to CNE about the incident, his injuries and why he arranged for the release of two of his attackers from prison.------CNE: Hi Mario, first question is how are you doing now?------M: My leg doesn’t look good. Big blisters full of blood leaking outside the bandage. I’ve got 3 splintered teeth and one broken in half. The other half I already took out myself.------I found out my foot is broken in two places and really need a surgery with screws to fix it back.------CNE: The local media in Cambodia can be pretty vague with details, could you explain what actually happened to you?------M: Sure. I went into the Drynk Bar to say hello to two old friends with my wife and her 3 year old son. I don’t go out much, maybe only 1 time a month.------ The three guys were drunk . I know two of them from seeing them around town and they know me in the same way. My wife had a relationship with the Slovakian guy, maybe that’s what caused the problem. The Indian guy I have never seen before.------I can defend myself pretty well, I used to be in the German military, but in this case I wasn’t lucky. I turned around and they attacked me.------I can’t remember a lot else. They started a fighting me, I fell backwards, twisted my leg and my hit head. When I woke up,  3 guys were punching me. and one started kicking my head. I blacked out, the woke up in hospital.------It was totally unprovoked, I was there with my family.------CNE: Brutal. Did they use weapons?------M: No, just hands and feet as far as I know.  The police have a video, but I haven’t see it yet.------ ------CNE: Did anyone try to help you?------M: No, You know Cambodians. Not interested in foreigner’s problems.------The owner of the Drynk bar didn’t call the police or ambulance. only from the Foxhead I got help in the form of calling the cops. I’ve known the owners of the bars for many years.------ I lost my passport, atm card, some money, a phone i need for business. But now I just worry about my leg.------C------NE: Another website has suggested you may have been attacked because of your business practices, is there any truth in this?------M: Absolutely not! I’m former director of a company selling huge incinerators for burning garbage. I work here in Siem Reap in the hospitality sector. We have worked with the government.------I studied IT-Engineering and am a former air force captain. I make real business here, to help make Cambodia a clean place.------CNE: Moving on to your attackers, you said you knew them?------No only 2 of them, the Indian guy I met first time. Like I say, I know them from seeing sometimes.  They are hanging out in the bars since forever.------CNE: People contacted CNE after we published the story, saying they were well known as bullies in town. “Iced up pr*cks” was one description.------M: Yes, they are, and yes, I heard the same.------CNE:  How have you found the police response?------M: So far they have been good. I’m confident the police will do a good job but it will take time.------CNE: Have you heard any talk of money to pay for their release or compensation to you? ------M:  Yes I need compensation. I cant work, I will lose my customer like Sokha etc. I lost documents, money, phone. they need to pay for that, that is what I was asking for. We made a contract at the police station about it.------For the material damage and my work it will be approx $7000, plus my medical treatment. When this is paid and done, then I’m fine. I think about it as a young boys fighting thing. I’m not angry about it. It happens. I was just not lucky this day.------But now I cant work and some important stuff is missing. maybe even the ambulance guys stole it, I don’t know.  I like my life quiet. I have real business here. We are waiting for our UN project starting in 3 months. I need my damage repaired and my health recovered, that’s it.------I’m told two of the guys have paid some compensation, and that has covered some of the earlier cost, so hopefully can pay the clinic for the operation I need.------CNE:  Do you want to see jail time for these guys, or live and let live? ------M:  Two are out on my behalf and one will be removed from Cambodia because he was now 3 times in jail, the Slovenien guy. The other two, I guess learned a lesson.------Actually, I was just sitting here with the Indian guy. He never did that before, even the police said so. I guess it was bad intelligence or he was too drunk.------I did file a complaint. but I know two of them are not the head of this evil. They will be nice people now, or they are going to the jail for a long time------I think everyone makes mistakes and earns a chance to show they can do better.------CNE: So what now?------M: I cant move. my leg has bloody blisters seeping out of my bandage. I’m more worried about the treatment as my atm card isn’t working anymore and my cash is gone.------ ------I don’t know how long it takes until they need to pay but since I  cant go back to Germany to my bank for a new atm card, I’m running low with the horrible costs here of the so called clinics. They charged $20 for an x ray they didn’t show me, and no word about how it continues.------ ------CNE: Well hopefully everything will work out better. Good luck Mario, and a speedy recovery.------M: Thanks, I hope too.------
