FEATURED,Latest,News;CNE can confirm that that  Ian Wilson and brother Jack were dropped off at Mount Aural this morning with a pair of rather reluctant local guides, who really didn’t want to spend the night in the jungle. And it rained.------Local authorities refused to give official permission for the expedition.------The supposed crash site is approximately 15km away from the road. They returned after a few hours……. more to follow in coming days.------Anyway, here’s the Daily Star’s take on this banal, yet accurate information….------Video producer Ian Wilson and brother Jack touched down in Cambodia’s capital Phnom Penh on Tuesday to kick start what could be a breakthrough mission.------The pair – who are currently staying at a guest house in Kampong Speu – are heading to an area Ian claims to have spotted the Boeing 777-200 from ------MH370------ on ------Google Maps------.------In the early hours of Friday morning UK time they will arrive at Chrok La Eang Waterfalls, a tourist hotspot.------But soon after they will set foot on their five-mile mission to the Pursat Province border, around four miles north of Phnom Aoral, we can reveal.------Their search could finally bring answers for the families of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members onboard the doomed flight – which went missing in March 2014.------Daily Star Online exclusively revealed how ------Ian spotted what could be MH370 while scouring Google Maps------.------It measures around 70metres, slightly longer than the Malaysia Airlines jet but with a mysterious gap between the tail and body.------Some experts believe it is simply a plane in flight, but Wilson is adamant his Google Maps sighting shows a plane on the ground and is determined to prove this.------He and Jack prepared themselves with tents and hiking equipment for the journey, although it is not known exactly how long it will take them to reach the spot.------Speaking from Cambodia, Wilson told Daily Star Online: “The first night we were in Phnom Penh, and earlier we headed west to a place in Kampong Speu, which is where we are now.------“At dawn we’re leaving for a place close to the Chrok La Eang waterfalls. It’s hard to see any real route to it by roads but it’s earmarked as a place for tourists to go so well find it.------“Then from there it’s anyones guess, that’s probably as close as anyone has been to the site.------Wilson will also look to claim the £54million reward money previously offered by the Malaysian Government for the plane.------He has been in contact with an owner from a local trekking company, who will drop them off tomorrow morning before their journey from Chrok La Eang.------He told us: “It’s extremely poor around here, I’ve never seen anything like it.------Daily Star Online understands the sighting is a plane captured in flight by Google Maps satellites.------But the extraordinary spot has drawn multiple theories since it was first published by this website.------Some have claimed it could be an old war plane from the Vietnam war, although the Aviation Safety Network (ASN) said it does not fit the profile of any crashes in their database.------ASN and aviation expert Jeff Wise believe it is a plane captured in flight, but this has been dismissed by private investigator and Unicorn Aerospace founder Andre Milne.------Wilson, an experienced Google Maps user, is convinced it is a jet on the ground having studied the image for the past two years.------He previously told us: “From every angle possible, it’s laying up against the mountain, and you can view it at ground level.------“I can’t take talk of it being airborne seriously at all. As I say it’s a program I use all the time and I’ve seen many planes in flight.------“If I thought this could be one of them I wouldn’t have bothered arranging vaccinations and saving money to go and find it.”------ ------RELATED ARTICLES------https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/737337/mh370-news-cambodia-search-mission-google-maps-latest-updates
