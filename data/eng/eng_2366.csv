Crime,FEATURED,Latest;*Taken
from Angkor Times, a Chinese language news blog for expats in Cambodia------Angkor
Times reported------ that
after Hun Sen issued a ban on gambling on August 18, a large number of Chinese
people left in Cambodia, and nearly 90,000 people have gone in the last 7 days,
most of them vegetable farmers* (*term referring to gambling practitioners).------A
relevant government department released a handwritten statistical data note to
the news media: From August 25 to 31, a total of 88,505 Chinese people left the
country, while 47,196 Chinese people entered the country, meaning the number of
Chinese in Cambodia decreased by 40,309 people. ------According
to this trend, the number of Chinese in Cambodia will be reduced by nearly
200,000 in September. (*This fits with an off the record message sent to CNE
from a source in SHK saying 50,000 had left by around the 27th).------At
about 5 o’clock on Monday morning, some people reported a large number of
police cars and military vehicles driving from Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville on
Highway 4, (which has led to rumors about an upcoming operation).------Caption reads: ------A large
number of military police went to Westport this morning.------A
vegetable farmer* (*gambling worker) in Westport/SHK told the Angkor Times
reporter that their company had returned all the passports to them on Monday
morning. “Our company is licensed, and it is not a killing pig (*doing
illegal scamming). Now more than 2,000 people have to withdraw, and they have
booked their tickets to return home.”------It
is said that many Chinese fugitives are still hiding here in Cambodia, and it
is suspected there will be more action in October (*to catch them). Because of
fears of being implicated, spinach (illegal gambling) companies such as Bobei
and Muqi are also preparing to clear out in advance.------*Many
people are saying this is ‘fake news’ and due to the mooncake festival. Several
sources (including Chinese speakers and those involved in SHK business, say
these reports have a large element of truth). CNE is reporting on what the
Chinese community is saying, and cannot verify any of these claims.------However there are other ------reports------ surfacing in Khmer ------media------ regarding the issue.
