FEATURED,Latest,Tourism;*We have been aware of this story, but usually missing persons cases are solved quickly. This may be something more serious, but hopefully Amelia will be found safe.------A YOUNG backpacker has gone missing in Cambodia.------Amelia Bambridge, from Worthing, was last seen by travelling companions in Koh Rong on Wednesday.------The 21-year-old, who is on a gap year, was due to check out of her youth hostel at noon today to leave the island later on this afternoon with a friend.------But ten hours later, and at 10pm local time, her mother has now been told by the hostel’s manager that her daughter has “been declared officially missing”.------Her handbag, which had her purse, phone and bank cards in it, has been found on a nearby beach.------The former BHASVIC student’s passport remains at the Nest Beach Club where she was staying.------Her mother, Linda Bambridge, who found out the news in the last hour, said: “This is very out of character, she is normally so organised.------“I don’t know what to think.------“The police have confirmed she is missing – apparently the embassy is closed until Monday.------“There doesn’t seem to be any urgency.------“Her friend is still there as they were due to leave the island today, but she hasn’t left because Amelia is missing.”------Amelia left the UK last month, taking time off work after completing her apprenticeship.------It is her first time travelling.------Ryan Harris, 18, who was part of the group travelling the Asian country with the 21-year-old, raised the alarm.------Ryan moved on to another island with plans to link back up with Miss Bambridge.------Cambodian police have been informed but Ryan said they had indicated nothing would be done until Miss Bambridge had been missing for 72 hours.------He said: “She was one of the first people I met over here about a week ago.------“I met her in Phnom Penh and we got the boat to Koh Rong, we all spent a few days together and met up with a few other people in a big group.------“We went on to a neighbouring island but she stayed there with another girl I know who had travelled with us on the boat over.------“I then had to travel back to Koh Rong after leaving my passport at the hostel and when I got there two people told me she had gone missing.------“I assumed she would turn up but I have since travelled another 12 hours on a bus to Siem Reap and she still has not been found. She is supposed to be in Siem Reap by now.------“From my experience I would say it is out of character for her not to come back after a few hours and it is a small island.------“Even if you go your separate ways after a few drinks you see people again ten or 20 minutes later. She should have come back by now.”------Ryan explained that the hostel held passports to ensure customers paid the bill but that Miss Bambridge had not gone back for hers.------“She hasn’t gone back for that or checked out which raises a red flag,”------Ryan added: “It is nearly 48 hours now (*published yesterday), that’s a long time not to be seen on such a small island.”------THE ARGUS
