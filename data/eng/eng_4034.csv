FEATURED,Latest,News;Scientists based at Edinburgh Zoo are cooperating to create a genetics laboratory in Cambodia to fight the illegal ivory trade.------While trying to save elephants, they have found ivory from another animal that is now extinct.------In the WildGenes laboratory of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, Dr Alex Ball is drilling what sounds like a giant tooth.------Which is in effect what it is: an ornately carved elephant tusk.------The lab is working with three partners in a project funded by the UK government’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.------Together they are building Cambodia’s scientific capacity to preserve its wildlife and combat the ivory trade which passes through it.------Dr Ball’s team has helped establish the first conservation genetics laboratory in Cambodia.------The country lies on an important route for smuggling ivory from Africa and Asia. Which continent the tusks have been stolen from can have legal implications.------“Elephants are being decimated in their thousands across Africa,” Dr Ball says.------“One of the key things about Cambodia is that we have hardly any information about the ivory trade.”------DNA from tusks is unlocking those secrets.------“We can basically break down that dentine and calcium and get those cells out the ivory – and then identify the individual that grew that tusk,” he added.------The WildGenes laboratory is the only zoo-based animal genetics lab in the UK and one of only a handful in Europe.------The head of conservation and science at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, Dr Helen Senn, says it plays an important role.------She continued: “Often endangered species are quite genetically unusual and unique and they haven’t been worked on before.------“They’re not interesting to medicine or agricultural science.------“So we have to develop novel methods to – for example – study pygmy hippos or scimitar-horned oryx.”------But in the work on Cambodian ivory samples the researchers have uncovered something even more exotic: DNA from woolly mammoths.------Mammoths are not covered by international agreements on endangered species for the unfortunate but unavoidable reason that they have already been extinct for around 10,000 years.------It is relatively easy to spot the difference between elephant and mammoth tusks.------But once the ivory has been carved into trinkets it is far harder.------“To our surprise, within a tropical country like Cambodia, we found mammoth samples within the ivory trinkets that are being sold,” says Dr Ball.------“So this has basically come from the Arctic tundra, dug out the ground.------“And the shop owners are calling it elephant ivory but we’ve found out it’s actually mammoth.”------y------Cambodia has between 250 and 500 wild Asian elephants of its own. It is difficult to assess how well or otherwise they are is faring – or even how big the population is – as they tend to stay deep within the jungle.------DNA sampling can provide an insight here too, although drilling tusks is not an option on live elephants.------Instead the conservationists have to seek out faecal samples – DNA from elephant dung identifies individual elephants and so builds a picture of the total population.------African elephants are classed as vulnerable, the Asian species is endangered.------The trade in their ivory goes hand in hand with smuggling other illegal products like rhino horn and pangolin scales.------That is why the partners are developing more genetic tools to help Cambodia identify other kinds of contraband before it is too late.
