Business & Property,FEATURED;Cambodia’s tech startup scene is growing despite challenges that persist for their young entrepreneurs and startup founders. With its increasing digital literacy, a population that is largely under the age of 30, and support from private firms and the government, Cambodia has a good foundation to amp up their innovation game and step out into the global stage.------This is evident during Echelon Asia Summit on June 2018.
