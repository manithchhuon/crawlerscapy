Crime,FEATURED,Latest;Shanghai: A total of 101 suspects have been caught in a telecom scam which was cracked after a local company lost about 35 million yuan (US$5 million) to the fraudsters, Shanghai police said on Thursday.------The gang allegedly made fraud calls targeting companies in China from their base in Cambodia.------The local company reported their loss to the police in Xuhui District on July 30.------Allegedly, an accountant at the company was asked via QQ, an instant messaging app, by an unknown person who claimed to be the boss to transfer 35 million yuan in total to several bank accounts from July 29 to 30. The accountant did so, only to discover later that the “boss” was a fraudster.------Police said this was the largest sum lost in a reported telecom fraud case in Shanghai this year.------In September, police caught a number of people who allegedly ran the QQ accounts.
