We do not yet know the exact specifications of the airport, and have not yet received a decision from the Council for the Development of Cambodia. Therefore, the project has not yet officially announced how much land will be developed and how much it will cost to build.------With the development project on Koh Rong under the investment of Royal Group of Okhna Kith Meng, this is the first big project to develop the island off the coast of Sihanoukville to become a world-class entertainment and tourism city. These include a five-star hotel, a golf course, a casino, a resort, a floating port, a bridge, a villa with a swimming pool, and a number of recreation centers. ------PROPERTY AREA
