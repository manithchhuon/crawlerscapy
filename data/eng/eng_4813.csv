It’s helpful to rule out this possibility.”------Following Wilson’s claim, a group of aviation experts flew a helicopter above the jungle and said they were hovering above his co-ordinates.------The experts said they found nothing, but private investigator Andre Milne – founder of military tech company Unicorn Aerospace – slammed their mission “useless” because they couldn’t get to the ground.------https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/732396/mh370-news-search-cambodia-theory-aviation-experts-google-maps-sighting
