Fake News,News;THE missing MH370 plane could be laying in the mountains of Cambodia, Daily Star Online can exclusively reveal.------Tech expert Ian Wilson has exclusively shown Daily Star Online where he believes a plane is lying in a high-altitude jungle.------His earth-shattering discovery is a potentially massive breakthrough in what has become the ------world’s greatest missing plane mystery in the history of aviation------.------And what makes our exclusive even more startling is the clues stack up to suggest Wilson HAS found the doomed airliner which vanished four years ago.------According to measurements of the plane he has found on ------Google Earth------, it is close to the length of ------MH370------‘s Boeing 777-200.------The body is around 70 metres in length – slightly larger than a Boeing 777’s official 63.7m measurement – but it has a mysterious gap between the tail and the body.------Wilson claims it is at ground level because Google Earth offers the option to “escape ground view” when close to the jet in the app.------This option suggests the plane could be at ground level, which would render it a must-see for investigators.------In contrast, ------other potential sightings of MH370 spotted on Google Maps------ have been ruled out by experts because satellite cameras sometimes photograph planes in mid-flight which do not get erased and end up on their Maps.------And, in another vital piece of the jigsaw which hugely strengthens Wilson’s claims, the Aviation Safety Network told us his sighting does NOT fit the profile of any crashes in the area.------What is more intriguing is the spot where the plane appears to sit on the ground is near an area in Cambodia air traffic controllers enquired about following its disappearance.------THEORY: A Google Maps sighting of a plane has sparked a search------SIGHTING: A snapshot of what appears to be a plane on Google Maps------Wilson exclusively told Daily Star Online: “The Boeing 777-200 is 63.7m in length.------“Measuring the Google sighting you’re looking at around 69 metres, but there looks to be a gap between the tail and the back of the plane.------“It’s just slightly bigger, but there’s a gap that would probably account for that.”------The UK-based video producer, inspired to search the area after questioning an MH370 documentary, added: “I just thought I’d have a wander through. I work in digital video so I’m on Google Earth all the time.------“So I was on there, a few hours here, a few hours there. If you added it up I spent hours searching for places a plane could have gone down.------The missing flight took off from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, with 227 passengers on board and 12 crew.------At 1.19am either Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah or the co-pilot told Malaysian air-traffic controllers: “Good night Malaysia Three Seven Zero.”------After those last words, the plane disappeared during a handover between Malaysian and Vietnamese air-traffic controllers with the transponder shut down.------Records released by the Malaysian Transport Ministry show that air traffic controllers were told by Malaysian Airlines the plane was in Cambodian airspace.------Hoh Chi Minh City controllers even sought confirmation that it was in Phnom Penh, east of Wilson’s Google Maps sighting.------MEASURED: The plane is around 70m in length according to Google------The MH370 Safety Investigation Report said radar and satellite analysis determined it flew back across the Malaysian peninsula, then towards the Indian Ocean.------They then conclude it ran out of fuel and crashed into the water west of Australia.------But investigators say they are not ruling out any possibilities, and conceded at the end of a 1,500-page report they do not know what happened to the plane.------It has not been found despite extensive searches, although a 2m piece of debris investigators said was from MH370 washed up on Reunion, an island off Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.------However, Wilson wants to search the sighting in Cambodia in the belief there could be be a flaw in the analysis.------Wilson told us: “They know the transponder was turned off for that flight, it could have gone anywhere.------“It’s assumed it turned south. But just north from there is Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.------“The route fits as well. It got to just where Malaysia switches to Vietnamese airspace.------“They know the plane went left after that, but after that everything else is conjecture.”------He added: “I’d love to search for it. I’m confident. It’s something I’d like to do.”------The Bureau of Aircraft Investigations Archives told us they could not rule out the Google Maps sighting – dating 2018 on Google Earth – being MH370.------However, the Aviation Safety Network insist the jet is flying above land and has been caught by Google in flight.------Google Earth marks the plane down as an Airbus, but Wilson believes this is a loose estimation.------Daily Star Online has approached Google for comment. ------https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/727012/mh370-news-malaysia-airlines-flight-google-maps-cambodia-theory-latest
