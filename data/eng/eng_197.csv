Environment,FEATURED,Latest;ISLAMABAD (Pakistan), Aug 4 (dpa): Veterinarians from an international animal rights group on Friday examined Kaavan, a ------lonely elephant at a Pakistani zoo------, ahead of his relocation to a sanctuary in Cambodia, following years of global outcry about his poor living conditions.------Kaavan the elephant would soon be sent to the South-east Asian country to end his three decades of misery in a small enclosure at Marghazar Zoo in Islamabad, where he spent most of his life in chains.------Vets from Four Paws, a Vienna-based body, had evaluated Kaavan’s physical and emotional health to see if he was fit for air travel and stable enough for a new life with other elephants.------Pakistani authorities would schedule his departure in the light of those suggestions, said doctor Anis Rahman of the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board.------“He needs training (before the relocation),” said veterinary surgeon Frank Goeritz, team leader and responsible for elephants at the Leibniz Institute in Berlin.------Kaavan developed erratic behaviour because he wasn’t trained by professionals at the young age, said Akmal Rana, a consulting veterinarian for the zoo.------“His miseries compounded when his mate, named Saheli, died in 2012,” Rana said, adding the elephant looked extremely bored and was desperately longing for company.------Kaavan threw around cleaning shovels, chased zoo staff and kept moving in distress during the examination before veterinarians gave him tranquillizers to calm him for taking blood samples.------The Cambodian sanctuary was chosen as it already houses more than 80 elephants and is equipped with experts and other related facilities. – dpa (Via ------THE STAR------) Photos: 4 Paws
