FEATURED,Health,Latest;On April. 10.2020 our little world turned upside-down and changed forever!------On this day, my son Mikey (Michael Grueneberg Jr.) was viciously attacked, robbed and savagely beaten. Leaving him for dead, on  a dark and dirty sidewalk in Sihanoukville, Cambodia; the attackers fled into the dark of night.------Someone, not known at this time, alerted a family member and Mikey was rushed by ambulance to the capital city, Phnom Penh.------He was merely clinging on to his life, when he was admitted into The Royal Phnom Penh Hospitals ICU-Unit.------His diagnoses was/is bleak:------ – severe head trauma in several locations------– severe abrasions on neck and shoulders------– bruised lungs on both sides------– internal bleedings and bruised organs------– many large cuts and bruising throughout the entire body------ Until today, Mikey has shown some progress, but is still in critical (stable) condition.------ He will need several brain-surgery’s once he becomes more stable.------The cost will be around $80000.- ++------Mikey is an American Citizen and we did not apply for any travel insurance, unfortunately. The cost for Mikey’s care is tremendous,------and we have already exhausted all our means!------Close friends have stepped in financially to keep him under the needed medical care.------Mikey is the father of 3-year-old Marlo, my grandson, who means Everything to him. Anyone who knows both of them will vouch    for that. None of us can even imagine for a little 3-year-old boy to   grow-up without a father…------ We realize that among us we will not be able to cover the cost and therefore reaching out to the world!------ We want to save Mikey’s life and asking for Your help,------ “Please give a donation to save Mikey’s live !!” ------GOFUNDME------CNE cannot verify the authenticity of these claims, and is in no way involved with the appeal.
