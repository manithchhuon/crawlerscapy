FEATURED,Traffic;Tbong ------Khmum:------ A speeding Prius took a detour off National Road 7 in Toul Chey village, Ponhea Krek district and somehow managed to travel about 30 meters across a water logged rice paddy.------Luckily the driver was not injured, but as a Prius is basically an expensive dodgem, and not a Land Rover Defender, he was quite stuck.------Fortunately, as darkness fell, a rice harvesting machine arrived and towed the car out of the swamp.------https://kohsantepheapdaily.com.kh/article/728881.html------Â
