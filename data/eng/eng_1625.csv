FEATURED,Latest,Sport;In what is either a sign of either his undiminished love for cycling or the inefficacy of his accountant, 48-year-old Monument winner ------Davide Rebellin ------is to sign with a Continental team in Cambodia for next year. ------At an age where most riders would have long since retired, the Italian racer is set to work alongside a host of unknown riders at the newly registered Cambodia Cycling Academy team. ------ Having turned professional in 1992, Rebellin will be riding for his 14th pro team should the deal go through. A once-fearsome Classics rider who was also handy in stage races, Rebellin scored wins at ------Liège–Bastogne–Liège------, Amstel Gold, La Flèche Wallonne, and the Giro dell’Emilia, along with overall victories at Tirreno–Adriatico and Paris–Nice.------ After announcing himself with a stage win at his native Giro d’Italia in 1996 – which saw him hold the Maglia Rosa for six days while riding for Polti – Rebellin’s most productive years came with the Gerolsteiner team between 2002–2008.------However, following a positive test for Mircera at the 2008 Olympic Games, Rebellin served a two-year suspension. On his return, he dropped down to the Pro-Continental level and rode for a string of teams, his 2013–2016 stint with CCC–Polsat–Polkowice proving the most productive.------After initially announcing his retirement, Rebellin was originally set to return to the Pro-Continental level with the Hungarian Epowers Factory Team next year, which would have raised the possibility of a return to his beloved ------Giro d’Italia------.------However, it now seems he’ll spend the next year or more riding for a mysterious squad of mostly unknown riders based in Cambodia. Still, he now has just another two years to go to become the first-ever 50-year-old pro rider. ------CYCLIST.CO.UK
