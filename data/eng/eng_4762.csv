Business & Property,FEATURED,Latest;The EU will also carry out human rights investigation in Myanmar, says trade chief.------10/5/18, 5:15 PM CET------The European Commission has ramped up trade pressure on Myanmar and Cambodia over rule of law and human rights concerns.------European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmström said Friday that both Myanmar and Cambodia risked losing preferential access to the EU market under the bloc’s so-called Everything But Arms arrangement, which permits tariff-free access for all exports except for weapons and ammunition.------“Today, High Representative Federica Mogherini and I have therefore notified Cambodia that we are launching the process for the withdrawal of their Everything But Arms preferences,” Malmström said ------in a blog post------ from a ministerial meeting in Austria. “Without clear and evident improvements on the ground, this will lead to the suspending of the trade preferences that they currently enjoy.”------The commissioner said the EU will also send an emergency mission to Myanmar in the coming days to carry out investigations related to human rights.------“There is a clear possibility that a withdrawal [from Everything But Arms] could be the outcome,” Malmström said.------Several EU countries are already considering ------expanding sanctions------ against Myanmar in the wake of calls from the United Nations for senior military officials from the country to be investigated for genocide against the Rohingya population.------In Cambodia, the ruling Cambodian People’s Party led by longstanding Prime Minister Hun Sen won elections in July after he arrested Kem Sokha, the leader of the now-dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), on accounts of treason. The EU’s step, if implemented, would threaten the all-important garment industry.------https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-threatens-trade-action-against-myanmar-cambodia-over-rights-record/
