Environment,FEATURED,Latest;Kandal :------ A boat which ------crashed into Prek Thmak bridge------ at 2 pm on September 8, has not yet been pulled away. Tests have been ongoing to see whether or not it will affect the structure.------Kong Vann, undersecretary of state at the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, who was present at the site on the morning of September 10, said the operation led by Senior Minister Sun Chanthol has so far not been able to remove the sand from the vessel. The strong river flow and the weight of the sand (about 1000m2) the ship was carrying have made any attempt to remove the boat difficult. However, Senior Minister Sun Chanthol is working on a new strategy.------What legal action the shipping company will face is not yet known. ------KBN
