FEATURED,Health,Latest;Siem Reap: CNE reader Simon Marshall has asked us to help find any Australians (or indeed any other nationalities) who could help take some skin medication to a young boy in Siem Reap.------“I was wondering if you could post this to help me find persons traveling to Siem reap that could help take moisture creams to a boy I sponsor?” He asked.------“I sponsor a 12 year old boy outside Siem Reap and struggling to get the certain cream to him he needs. It’s not in Cambodia so I am looking for person traveling from Western countries that could take a tub or two for him. Obviously I will pay you for the cream and many thanks for the help. I’m in Canberra Australia so especially anyone from here would make things easy. Here is my story link for your information only. I am not expecting any donations just help------ The one cream I personally tool to him a few weeks back is all that’s worked and call QV Cream by Ego Pharmaceuticals------ I personally took him to hospital and made a nice donation to ensure he got a decent diagnosis and treatment this time. Too many people seem to have tried to exploit him, I feel and that’s just not happening again”------The background story------:------“This is poor Hon Panha who is 12 years old. Panha was born with a rare incurable skin condition which leaves his skin dried out, in constant need of scratching and leaving sores all over his tiny body. Doctors have no cure for him and he is left to suffer in agonizing torment as the flies continue to bite and pick at his skin.------He lives with his mum in Srah Raing Village, Banteay Meanchey Province Cambodia. A very poor house hold and his mother struggles.just to feed him. His father left the family when he was only 3 months old. For 12 years he has suffered with no means to buy the much needed creams and medicine for controlling the condition.------With your help and mine, we can get these items to him and also provide him some basic medical care to ease his suffering. With time he too could enjoy a normal life that many of us just take for granted.”------You can contact Simon by email:  Simon.marshall77@outlook.com------or direct message on Facebook. ------https://www.facebook.com/simon.marshall.313
