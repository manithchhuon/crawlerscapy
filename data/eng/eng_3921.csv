FEATURED,Latest,Sport;Nou Srey Pov ------has officially become the next Cambodian to join the world’s largest martial arts organization, ------ONE Championship------, and she already has her debut set.------She will make her first promotional appearance at ONE: CLASH OF LEGENDS, which emanates from the Impact Arena in Bangkok, Thailand on Saturday, 16 February. ------The 22-year-old ------Cambodian Top Team------ (CTT) representative is scheduled to face Thai star Rika “Tiny Doll” Ishige.------Srey Pov ------got everyone’s attention in 2018------ as she was awarded Lethwei World Championship’s “Female Fighter Of The Year” and became the Kun Khmer World Champion with an impressive performance in front of her local Phnom Penh crowd.------Now, she looks to conquer the sports of mixed martial arts, and her first test comes against one of Thailand’s most famous female competitors in an exciting atomweight bout.------Her opponent, Ishige, is a true superstar in “The Land Of Smiles.” She has been competing in ONE Championship since early 2017, having amassed a professional record of 4-2 with all of her victories coming via stoppage.------The 29-year-old Thai will be a tough test for Srey Pov, who looks to compete in mixed martial arts for the first time in her life.------“I am very happy and excited, but also nervous at the same time,” the Cambodian explains.------“I have never fought in MMA before, but I have told myself to train really hard and be as prepared as I can be.------“Most people tell me that I won’t be able to make it. But I am used that, and I constantly remind myself that I can achieve whatever I set my mind on.”------The news about Srey Pov’s debut is already all over the Cambodian news, but she found out herself by CTT leader Hun Chan Reach in a somewhat different way.------“My trainer [Chan Reach] called me and told me there was something that we needed to talk about,” she recalls.------“When I arrived at Cambodian Top Team, they surprised me with a really intensive and crazy training session. I was not prepared to be training that hard and, oh my God, it was very intense!------“After the training, my trainer [former ONE Championship athlete Nicholas “JJ” Lee] asked if I was fighting for money or honor. I replied, ‘I’m fighting for honor, and not for money at the moment.’”------Srey Pov was then told ONE Championship had been in contact with them, and she was presented with two bout offers — one at ONE: CLASH OF LEGENDS in Bangkok and one at ------ONE: REIGN OF VALOR------ in Yangon. ------“I agreed to the fight in Thailand,” she admits. “But was warned that Ishige is a very powerful opponent.” ------The Cambodian is now in full preparation ahead of her Bangkok clash with “Tiny Doll.”  ------What the Kun Khmer World Champion lacks in experience, however, she makes up for in talent.------“My coach [Lee] praised me and told me that I learn very fast,” Srey Pov shares.------“I know my striking is good already. However, I still have a lot to learn in grappling, especially since my opponent’s ground game is really good.”------Already making leaps in progress, the CTT product is determined to be adequately prepared when she makes her debut in The Home of Martial Arts next month.------“Because I have better boxing, I will make sure I hit her before she has a chance to grab me,” she explains.------“All in all, I will train hard until I’m confident enough to take her on. That’s all I’m thinking about right now.”------For this, and all things Cambodian boxing related, visit our friends at ------www.khmerkolang.com
