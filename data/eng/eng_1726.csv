FEATURED,Latest,Tourism,Traffic;Cambodia has some of the highest rates of
disabilities in the world with some estimates as high as 15%. One of the most
basic barriers people with disabilities face is transport – they are living in
a place that does not allow them to easily get around.------Putting two more two more mobilituks on the road will address this basic need, and, create stable livlihoods for two drivers.------The Mobilituk is a wheelchair accessible
tuk tuk that aims to help people with disabilities get out and about, to
participate in life, education and employment.------The goal of this fundraiser is to build 2
more tuktuks that are accessible for people with physical disabilities living
in or visiting Cambodia. The simple innovative design fits a rear ramp and
adjustable seats to a tuktuk, allowing for easy access for wheelchair users as
well as leaving space for two other passengers.------They can also be used as a standard tuk tuk
for 4-5 passengers if the wheelchair capability isn’t in use.------Get on board and let’s get rolling!------Donate by clicking here------! Share and do something great for this Kingdom of Wonder.------Submitted to CNE charity department by Alexandra Kennet.------This appeal is from an outside source and CNE have no vested interests in any of the above or the campaign..
