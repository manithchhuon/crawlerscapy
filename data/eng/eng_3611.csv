Environment,FEATURED,Latest;By: Kanthea / Phnom Penh: For------ a moment, it seems that this is land growing in a canal. It is Boeung Trabek in Chamkar Morn, Phnom Penh, but in fact, it is a garbage pile that flows through the water.------Where does the trash come from? This is a recurring story. Capital administration and departments always tell people, traders, travelers … please dispose of garbage properly;do not throw it in the drainage.------Only by joining together can we reduce garbage, rather than let it cause congestion in drainage canals.------These pictures were taken on February 26, 2019. Let’s join together to help the city!------Rasmei News
