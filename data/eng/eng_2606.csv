Crime,FEATURED,Latest;Phnom Penh: ------A man was arrested for possession of a stimulant on July 24------ in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. The Cambodian media said on the 25th, “Two small sachets of stimulant were found in the possessions, detaining Japanese design engineer Hatamura Yuichi, who had been making suspicious movements, in a downtown area in central Phnom Penh.” I reported it all at once. However, when FNN confirmed with the Japanese embassy, ​​it got an unexpected response. ------The man was not Japanese------After receiving a report on the Japanese arrest, a Japanese embassy representative immediately met with the person. As a result, it was found that the man was not Japanese. However, Cambodian media also believes the Cambodian police saying “Japanese arrested.” ------Why is this happening? FNN also contacted police and confirmed the authenticity of the information and found that the man was lying at the time of his arrest.------The arrested man was Korean nationality------When FNN interviewed a local Cambodian police, it became clear that the man was arrested making suspicious movements in downtown Phnom Penh on the night of the 24th, he was detained by a local police officer and taken to the police station. Two packets of stimulant (meth) were found. After that, the man told the police officer that “I am Japanese. The name is Hatamura Yuichi. I am 38 years old.” Based on the information, it was reported “Japanese arrest” at the same time. ------However, when a person in charge at the Japanese embassy interviewed the person directly, it turned out that he could not understand Japanese at all. Even though he said that he was “Japanese,” he later found out that the man was not Japanese, but Korean. ------To confirm the authenticity, FNN confirmed the suspect’s passport. On the cover of the man’s passport, the letters “Republic of Korea”. The man had entered Cambodia with a Korean passport. “KANG JU SUNG” and the photograph of the face was clearly the same person as the man who was arrested.------In Cambodia, a taxi robbery killing by two Japanese adolescents just happened in the northwestern part of Siem Reap in Cambodia this year. This incident has a great impact on Cambodia, known as pro-Japanese country, and after that, various efforts such as fundraising and support for bereaved families were done to restore the lost trust of Japanese society and volunteers in Cambodia. ------Under such circumstances, it is a lie that oneself is “Japanese” and as a result, being reported all at once in Cambodian media as “the Japanese being arrested” is an effort to restore the credibility of the resident Japanese. It is an act that breaks the step. ------It is not clear why the man named himself “Japanese”.------SOURCE
