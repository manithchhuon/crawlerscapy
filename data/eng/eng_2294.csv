That’s socialism: Forced obedience. Starvation,” Heng narrates to visuals from the ’70s genocide.------“Mine is a face of freedom, my skin is not white, I’m not outrageous, racist, nor socialist. I’m a Republican,” she concluded.------Ocasio-Cortez twice responded to the ad, criticizing Heng, first with mild bemusement.
