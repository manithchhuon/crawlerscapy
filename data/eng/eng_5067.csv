How to save your time, gas and money while helping your city reduce its traffic jam?------
It’s 2018 and we all know about a major problem that covers Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, we’re talking about the TRAFFIC JAM. People might have noticed already that at the end of the day, between 5PM and 7PM, the streets get paralyzed and it becomes really difficult to move.------Approximately 15-20% of those who are stuck in the traffic are actually on the way to get their grocery shopping done, either for cooking dinner or for filling up the fridge for the next couple of days.------
Now imagine what would happen, if it would possible to eliminate those 15-20% from the traffic?! Right, the cities will get less agglomerated and it would become a lot easier to drive or ride.------Back in 2017, Victor Logos, an expat living in Cambodia, thought about traffic jam problems, and he also predicted that it’s just going to get worse and worse, so he decided to create a team and start Cambo Market.------
