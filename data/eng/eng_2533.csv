Environment,FEATURED,Latest;Sihanoukville â€“ On the morning of August 06, 2019, the Sihanoukville authorities, Department of Public Works, Water Resources and Wastewater Departments and waste contractors once again collected garbage from Sangkat 4, after tons of rubbish flowed down the stream following heavy rainfall.------The images are------ eerily similar------ to others from recent months. Apart from the waste being partly responsible for the flooding that has been plaguing the city after each heavy shower, there is the all-to-real risk of a disease outbreak, should the weather continue to cause problems on the streets.------Source: Huy Bunleng
