Business & Property,Environment,FEATURED,Latest;A 9.8MW PV project featuring rooftop and floating elements is approaching the finish line in Cambodia, breathing new life into a national PV scene still stuck in the low-double-digit MW region.------Cleantech Solar------ is building, financing and running a dual PV installation – 2.8MW in panels floating over a reservoir plus a further 7MW across rooftops – to power a production plant owned by the Chip Mong Insee Cement Corporation (CMIC) in the Kampot province.------PV Tech------ understands the floating element is now fully built while the rooftop portion is nearing completion, with plans for the PV plant to become fully operational by late March 2019.------Cleantech Solar, the builder of 200MW-plus of solar capacity in Southeast Asia and India, expects its rooftop-plus-floating scheme to generate 297GWh in power. The project should slash CMIC’s CO2 emissions by 197,000 tonnes throughout its lifespan, said the Singaporean developer, ------partially owned by Shell------ since last December.------Once it is up and running, the project is set to bolster Cambodia’s still modest PV ecosystem. Capacity has steadily risen since the early 2010s but ------barely surpassed the 27MW mark------ in 2017, according to IRENA.------With the help of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the country is working to build large-scale solar into an energy mix still heavily reliant on coal, hydro and imports from Vietnam and Thailand.------The development financier supported in 2017 the country’s first large-scale PV solar scheme. Slated for construction by Sunseap Group, the ------10MW Bavet farm------ is set to supply power to Cambodia’s electricity regulator EDC under a 20-year PPA.------Even more significant is the ADB-backed ------100MW National Solar Park project------, which will kick off with the setup of a 60MW plant in the Kampong Chhnang province. Under ------tender documents------published by EDC in mid-February, aspiring developers can table bids until 17 May 2019.------An unclear legislative framework – PV was unregulated in Cambodia until last year – and grid connection bans for low-voltage facilities have impacted C&I solar in particular. ------As advised by lawyers approached by ------PV Tech------, rooftop developers must ensure they have the necessary building permits and rights to use the site throughout the PPA duration.------SOURCE
