FEATURED,Latest,News;A Queenstown couple have become heroes in an impoverished Cambodian village after bankrolling and building a new school, which they hope to expand.------Architectural designer Mark Hillary and his wife Julie Carlaw-Hillary, a teacher, spent last year working on the project in Ou Ambel Village, near Siem Reap, which will be finished on February 28.------To date they have invested $40,000 of their own money into the project which started when Mr Hillary was asked by Sergio Antunes, a New Zealand friend based in Cambodia, to design a school for the children to replace a dilapidated two-room barn with no toilets or water.------That school was used by 120 children aged 5 to 15.------The Hillarys have since upgraded the barn to cater for 256 children, and convinced the Cambodian Government to give a piece of land for the new school which will cater for another 400.------Queenstown couple Mark Hillary and Julie Carlaw-Hillary have built a new school in an impoverished village in Cambodia. PHOTO: SUPPLIEDThe new school features four “pod-style” classrooms, four toilets and two medical rooms.------Mr Hillary said at times the couple had questioned why they took on what initially appeared to be a simple project, particularly after his wife battled a life-threatening illness last year.------“The question was, `how can we build a school here?’,” he said.------“Within a few weeks of witnessing the desperation there for education, that question had changed to `how can we not build a school and leave these kids like that in poverty?”‘------The couple battled Cambodian bureaucracy but “miraculously” managed to get approvals for the new school almost six months ahead of the usual timeframe.------The Hillarys, joined by Queenstown builder Richard Short and his family, travelled to Cambodia to build a playground for the children while waiting for the school consents.------Once building started, the children filled washing baskets with soil and moved bricks to help the contractors every night after school, Mr Hillary said.------“What really moved me was watching a father drive his tractor on to the proposed school site renowned for its hidden land mines with his children’s two grandfathers hobbling out in front.------“Some of the locals told me those two old guys had badly damaged legs from standing on land mines previously.------“That’s the extent of the desperation there for children to be educated.”------The couple were now contemplating selling their caravan and boat to fund the remainder of the project – there were still 1000 children around the village needing an education and each pod costs $82,000.------They hoped to build more pods and a child care facility.------To date they had raised about $23,000.------To support, visit: ------https://bit.ly/2VDlYLj ------F------https://www.odt.co.nz/regions/queenstown/couple-building-future-schoolchildren-cambodia
