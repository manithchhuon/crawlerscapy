FEATURED,Health,Latest;PEA REANG, Cambodia — Far outside the increasingly modern capital of Phnom Penh, out amid countless waterlogged rice paddies and farms of pink lotus blossoms where villagers eat deep-fried tarantulas as a treat, a survivor lies in a hospital bed tethered to brand new medical equipment.------The genocide she lived through as a teenage girl wiped out a third of Cambodia’s population. The murderous Khmer Rouge executed most of the people with formal education, especially doctors and nurses: 95% of them died or fled the country in the late 1970s.------Now 56, Chun Phaly faces a new threat that challenges the capacity of her province’s health care system. In fact, her sister brought her to the hospital in Pea Reang (pia re-ANG) from a neighboring province, drawn by reports of the new capabilities at this rural hospital, with its eight small, single-story, white stone buildings. One building houses a tuberculosis ward, and it is full.------“I heard Pea Reang had the best hospital,” Phaly says.------The tools her caregivers are using to save her life were unavailable here three months ago.------Phaly recently has grown weaker and weaker. Daily tasks began to leave her short of breath. Then she no longer could walk across a room without feeling dizzy and lightheaded. So her sister packed her up three days ago and brought her to this hospital with a growing reputation as shiny as its new equipment. A new report recently ranked Pea Reang Referral Hospital the nation’s third best.------Here, a medical assistant inserted an IV line in the back of her right hand, placed a white oximeter clip on her right forefinger to measure her oxygen level in her blood. Around her left bicep, a nurse placed a gray cuff attached by a gray cord to a sparkling white electrocardiogram machine that measures her heart’s electrical activity. The monitor revealed her problem. She has Brady cardia, an arrhythmia with a dangerously low heart rate, well below the normal range of 60 to 100 beats per minute. Such a low heart rate is typically a sign of heart damage or disease.------The medical team prescribed a five-day course of medicine. Three days later, as a reporter visited the hospital, the staff puts the oximeter back on her forefinger and returns the cuff to her bicep.------The gold number on the monitor — 64 — shows the medicine is working. She feels better.------Phaly is fortunate. Cambodia doesn’t have paramedics. Emergency rooms and emergency care are rare. So is basic cardiac care and equipment.------She is the beneficiary of a unique new partnership with Latter-day Saint Charities that is rapidly improving basic emergency care and other conditions at this hospital and its satellite health centers in surrounding villages. A surprisingly strong relationship has emerged between the government of a country whose 16.5 million citizens are 98% Buddhist and the Christian charity sponsored by a church with fewer than 15,000 members in all of Cambodia.------READ FULL STORY HERE
