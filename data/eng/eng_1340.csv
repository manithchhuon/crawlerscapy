I am truly humbled and it’s a huge honour. Australia Day means a great deal to me and my family. Being Australian is what binds us together and is something we are very proud of. I have been thinking a lot about what it means to be Australian. A few words that come to mind are multicultural, proud, passionate, and determined. A reflection I can see in myself and others around me. A place where I can bring my passion for promoting Cambodian culture, identity, and food to Australia and the world. Through hard work and determination, I have been able to achieve my goal and lead by example for other young Australians. I truly view this award not just as an award for me but as an endorsement of young Australian leadership roles. It is an encouragement for young Australians to pursue their dreams. Whether big or small, it does not matter, because no vision is ever too small. Your short term goals may not define where you might be in the future.------Over my first year running Little Khmer Kitchen I have received lots of encouragement and support from people across Adelaide, from interstate and overseas, but most particularly the stall holders within the Adelaide Central Market and Arcade. We have a strong sense of community. They are my supporters and mentors. Furthermore, a big thank you to my loyal customers for believing in me. Thank you to those who nominated me and thank you Australia Day Council for this award. I congratulate all the other nominees. There are so many inspiring people there today, and in that regard I feel very humble.------I will continue to work hard, and to do my best to create a better Australia.------Orkun – Thank you”------A well known Australian restaurant owner and Sunday roast aficionado told CNE:------“Great to see Cambodian cuisine and Culture recognised internationally.”------Read more about Little Khmer Kitchen ------HERE
