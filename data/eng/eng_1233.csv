Crime,FEATURED,Latest;When disgraced Ottawa lawyer J.D. Coon fled the country as a child-sex fugitive in December 2013, he went to Cambodia to teach at a children’s school.------Coon, who specialized in child-protection law, was accused back in September 2013 of molesting a young Ottawa girl. The police theory is that the defence lawyer molested the girl, told her he loved her and to keep it a secret.------According to police, Coon, then 49, denied the accusations in a September 2013 police interview and he took a polygraph in November 2013. Ottawa police then called Coon and asked him to turn himself in on charges of sexual assault, sexual interference and invitation to sexual touching.------But instead of turning himself into police, Coon got a work permit and went to Cambodia where he got a job as a schoolteacher.------Police sent a patrol officer over to his house in January 2014 but Coon was long gone, and in fact had left the country four weeks earlier.------Ottawa police then obtained a warrant for his arrest and told the media at the time that they feared there could be more victims.------Coon was arrested when he returned to Canada on Aug. 3 on an international flight to Vancouver. Since then his child-sex crimes case has been making its way through the Ottawa Courthouse, with Coon most recently appearing on Feb. 6. No trial dates have been set.------Coon pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a girl in 1991 but was granted a conditional discharge, which means he was spared a criminal record after 15 months’ probation.------Though the Law Society knew about his child-sex crime history, Coon was granted a licence to practise law and went on to specialize in child-protection only to be accused of molesting another young girl.------Coon abruptly stopped practising law in late 2013 amid the Ottawa child-sex investigation, fled the country, lived as a fugitive for five years and is now in jail awaiting prosecution for his latest sex charges involving children.------Coon’s licence has since been revoked. ------OTTAWA CITIZEN
