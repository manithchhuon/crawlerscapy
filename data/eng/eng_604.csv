Causes traffic congestion and possible traffic accidents------2. No public order and social order------3. Detracts from the city’s beauty------4. Traders do not properly dispose of garbage, causing environmental impact------5. Traders are not residents of Sihanoukville, but most are from different provinces------6. Most tuk-tuk and mobile traders say they sleep in tuk-tuks and  cars. Some say they squat unoccupied private land.------According to the source, Sihanoukville Municipality will put in place measures from June 22, 2020, and the city administration will not allow such selling any more. In case of non-compliance with the instructions, the Municipal Administration will use administrative measures to seize the vehicles and goods for the first time and keep for for 1-2 weeks. The second time offenders will not have their property returned.------It was also stated that the Sihanoukville government does not prohibit anyone who wants to do business in the city, but sellers must look for a clear and legitimate location for a business, not the street, sidewalk, beach and public places. ------KBN
