FEATURED,Latest;A Facebook account named Mãĸ Õřñ posted several photos of a nephew’s wedding. The unusual thing about these nuptials are, that it is claimed the groom is only 14, and his bride 21 years old. The post says something along the lines of:------“9/11/2019 is a special day for nephew & niece. Wishing only happy couple…..  21 year old bride, 14 year old (groom), though old/ young mentality we find interest in future, we will be happy to love tolerance mutual, na (sorry aunt cannot be there)’ ------*Whether this is actually true, or some sort of odd hoax, remains to be seen, but CNE wish them all the best.
