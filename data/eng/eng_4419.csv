Still hurts now! Also backed to China, I will never ever go back to this shithole! ( 枫叶^O^泪滴 Fengye Leidi)------However, some comments from Chinese people on WeChat are less than sympathetic to their countrymen.------换位思考一下吧，脚踏他国地，头顶别国天，嚣张跋扈横蛮无理，只会自讨苦吃，自作自受，，请尊重当地的文化，遵守当地的法律，入乡随俗，低调做人。 On the other hand, living in a foreign country, if you being rude and disrespectful to locals, it’s never going to be a good thing… please respect local culture, obey local laws, adapt to local life and stay low-profile. ( 小斌-Ben (Xiaobin))------大家评心而论。中国哪个城市有西港这样离谱的物价与消费！都是国人自己闹的。和别人的国情和本地市场完全不附。有几个本地人能接受这样的市场泡沫。他们本地人有几个能消费的来！有房子住不起！不抱怨不仇恨还不正常了！换位思考一下。来柬埔寨投资的大佬们！ To be honest, which city in China are as expensive as Sihanoukville(compared to average salary)? it’s Chinese fellows fault! How many locals can afford the price nowadays?! It would be abnormal if They don’t complain and getaway angry. Please think in other people’s shoes, Chinese investors!
