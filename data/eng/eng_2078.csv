FEATURED,Health,Latest;*It’s a tragic reality that every day at least one child’s death from drowning is reported in local media. Normally CNE does not cover the incidents, not because they are unimportant, but because they stir up both anger and grief. However, to highlight the issue, we have decided to publish this story and ask all parents and guardians to take care of children and prevent such grossly unnecessary deaths.------Prey Veng:------ A tragic incident resulted in a baby’s death in Trapaing Chhouk village, Rach Chek commune, Preah Sdach district, Prey Veng province on October 17, 2019 at 1:35 pm.------The child was identified as Chan Sereyvong, an 8-month-old male.------The victim was in a baby roller chair, and fell into floodwater as his mother was busy doing housework.------Police later confirmed the infant had died of drowning. ------POST NEWS
