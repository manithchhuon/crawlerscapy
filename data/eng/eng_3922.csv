Crime,Fake News,FEATURED,Latest;Thailand: A Thai man living in a block of flats called KK in Sri Racha was curious when his wife’s smalls went missing a while back. ------So Charin Ong-sem from Petchaburi made it his mission to keep a close watch for anyone behaving suspiciously. He was sure a thief was at work and they’d be back. ------On Sunday he got a break in the case with the arrival of a likely suspect on a Honda Scoopy-i with no plates. ------The man was not a resident of the flats and was looking suspicious as he went behind the dwellings and started peering in. Charin kept a close watch before moving in. ------He made a citizen’s arrest and found a whole stack of evidence in the form of bras and panties under the bike seat of Cambodian national Sor Miang, aged about 25. ------The red-handed and red-faced Sor looked quite a sight next to his red Honda as Charin called the Laem Chabang constabulary for back-up. ------The cops came and took the Cambodian away – but not before Charin did some admirable pointing at the scene of the knicker nicking. ------Sor Miang might have found it difficult to point as it looked as though he had already been cuffed.------The cops believe the items under the bike seat had been stolen from elsewhere.------The thief appears to have said nothing as he was not quoted in the Daily News story. ------They just described him helpfully as a foreign pervert. ------Translation: ------Thai Visa------Source: ------Daily News
