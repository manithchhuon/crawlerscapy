FEATURED,Health,Latest,Tourism;It was the holiday of a lifetime that turned into a nightmare, and it all started with a mosquito bite.------Donna Cox, 22, flew to South East Asia to celebrate the end of her Masters degree and embark on an adventure.------Donna, from Wardle in ------Rochdale------ , had all of the necessary vaccinations and booked a one-way ticket to Vietnam in September.------“I was having the time of my life,” says Donna.------“I met some absolutely amazing people.------“I never expected it all to end as quickly as it did.”------Donna’s ordeal started when she noticed a painful mosquito bite on her right leg when she was in Cambodia.------“There was a lump around the bite on my shin.------“It just didn’t seem right.------“I’d been bitten loads when I was over there. The mosquitos seemed to love me.------“But the redness and the pain around this one bite started to spread up and down my leg.”------Donna went to the pharmacist to get antibiotic cream on the advice of the hostel manager, but a day later the swelling returned and it became too painful for her to put weight on her right foot.------“I remember saying to some of the girls in the room ‘Guys, I’m not being dramatic but I think I’m going to die or lose my leg.’------“I was only joking but it almost ended up coming true.”------With cash running low, Donna decided to book a flight back to the UK in October.------It was a painful flight back and when she made it to Rochdale the bite only got worse.------Donna ended up in ------Rochdale Infirmary------ A&E where an X-Ray revealed a ‘collection’ under her leg.------Doctors consulted with the North Manchester Infectious Diseases team and the next day Donna was rushed to the Royal Oldham Hospital where she was diagnosed with a flesh-eating infection called Necrotising Fasciitis.------The rare bacterial infection spreads rapidly and can be fatal.------Donna started to fall unconscious and developed Sepsis. Her body was starting to shut down.------The following four days were a blur for Donna.------She underwent three operations on her leg, and was diagnosed with compartment syndrome.------Donna signed a form to consenting for her leg to be amputated should her condition worsen.------She had another limb saving procedure to ease the pressure building in her right leg.------“The bone in my leg had softened and the necrotising fasciitis was eating my leg,” she said.------“It was only because I was young and strong that I survived.”------There was many traumatising moments for Donna during her time in hospital.------Medics left her wounds open to ease the pressure in her lower leg, before closing it with 90 staples.------At one stage Donna wore an eye-mask so she didn’t have to look at her leg.------Doctors told Donna if she had gone to hospital four hours later she would have died.------“I was in hospital for five weeks in total,” adds Donna.------“The consultants and all the staff were absolutely amazing.------“But I had some very dark moments when I was there and I felt really isolated at times.------“So many people go travelling and there are times where I feel angry that this happened to me.------“I’m still struggling to process what happened because so much of it is a blur.”------Donna’s illness has changed her life forever, and while she survived, she has lost all sensation in her lower right leg and is now learning how to walk again.------Her leg is covered in scars and she has a foot drop.------But Donna is determined to regain her strength and managed to walk across the stage at her graduation at Edge Hill University.------“It’s had such a dramatic impact on my life.------“I used to love being active and would go to the gym every day.------“Now I struggle to walk to the bathroom.------“All of my independence has been stripped away from me and that’s been really hard.------“There are so many things you take for granted. I can’t bend my toes in my right foot anymore and that’s really difficult.------“It’s only thanks to my amazing friends, family and everyone at the hospital that I’ve got through this.------“That’s why walking at my graduation was such a massive moment for me.------“This whole experience has put everything into perspective.”------Donna hopes by sharing her story that other people will be aware of the symptoms of necrotising fasciitis.------She added: “I would hate for this to happen to anyone else.------“If my story encourages people not to ignore any bites or pains and potentially saves their life, it will make what happened to me that little bit easier for me to accept.” ------MANCHESTER EVENING NEWS
