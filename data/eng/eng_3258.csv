FEATURED,Health,Latest;Abu Hodu sadly passed away last week after some time in hospital in Phnom Pehn. He was 53 years young. It is going to cost up to $20,000USD to bring his body back to Israel so it can be laid to rest with his family. As nobody has this sort of cash to spare and his young wife Haruna and six year old son Theo are unable to fly back for the funeral, we ask that you dig deep and spare anything you can to help raise money so that Abu may be buried in his homeland and be given a funeral with his family. ------Abu was the silent partner for well loved and established underground party ‘Kerfuffle Cambodia’ for almost 7 years. We ask the thousands of revellers who danced in the dust till sunrise, loved laughed and experienced this magical place to give just a few dollars each to make sure his body will be returned home safely.------To somebody who always lived life exactly as he wanted, raved till sunrise with the best of them, travelled the world and lived life to the full. It has been a rollercoaster brother, and we will miss you dearly. See you on the flip side my man. Sunny Side Up. Xxx------“Abu was our life teacher and I will forever hold him in my heart.” ~ Haruna Saragai xxx------***The money is to cover Abu’s stay in hospital before he passed, 3 weeks in Intensive Care, Repatriation, Funeral Expenses and in order to fly his wife and son to Israel for the funeral and then home again to Japan. If we raise enough there may be a little spare to give to the family in order to start again as they have been left with nothing and wish to return to their home country after living with Abu for the past years in Cambodia.------https://www.gofundme.com/fly-abu-home-to-israel-so-he-can-be-laid-to-rest?fbclid=IwAR3NFR5IoC2Eq15in3WM9n6132HGCGAU-Tyh6QE1xNABO5JP3vTyNY23Bso
