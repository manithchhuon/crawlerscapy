Environment,FEATURED,Latest;Phnom Penh: Residents along the Bassac as well as the Lower Mekong River are worried as the river still hasnâ€™t risen to normal early monsoon levels.------Yas Hay Saing Ra, a resident of the Bassac River in Sangkat Chbar Ampov II, Khan Chbar Ampov, Phnom Penh, told ------Kampuchea Thmey,------ that every year, on the morning of July 3, the river is normally at least half way up the banks. This 3 July, the water is still at the bottom.------Mr. Phoeung, who is 95 years old, said he was wondering why in July there is not enough water for the river. Without having to go down to measure it accurately, it can be seen under the old Monivong Bridge, it is clear that the water level is still very low under the bridge compared with all other years. He asked the angels to help bring the rain down, so we were not afraid to lose water next dry season.
