Business & Property,FEATURED,Latest;Cambodia’s potential loss of its Everything But Arms (EBA) preferential ------trade------ access to the European Union (EU) would weaken its economic growth and lead to a credit negative, Moody’s Investors Services has cautioned. With a B2/stable sovereign rating, it would undermine the price competitiveness of its garment exports unless they are offset by productivity gains.------In a recent ------report------, Moody’s said rising costs will make the ------country------ less attractive as a production base and could weaken foreign direct investment, a contributor to its economic stability.------Competition from regional rivals also poses a significant threat, global news wires reported citing the document.------Bangladesh is more capable of scaling production and has a 6.5 per cent share of the global apparel market compared to Cambodia’s 1.6 per cent.------Vietnam’s free trade agreement with the EU and its membership in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership would also aggravate Cambodia’s competitive challenges, Moody’s said.------Around 40 per cent of Cambodia’s goods exports go to the EU, valued at $4.3 billion last year, or 20 per cent of GDP. Of this, around 90 per cent are sold through the EBA initiative.------Any negative effect on garment employment and wages would weigh on domestic demand, which has supported overall growth in Cambodia, it said.------However, the rating agency said the withdrawal of the EBA could accelerate the country’s efforts to diversify into other manufacturing industries.
