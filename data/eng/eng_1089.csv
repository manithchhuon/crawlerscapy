Business & Property,FEATURED,Latest;Casino operator ------Donaco International------ (ASX:DNA) can now put its legal woes over its Star Vegas casino behind it.------The company’s casino, in the town of Paôy Pêt (*Poipet)— right on Cambodia’s border with Thailand, was leased on the basis that the vendors would not run gaming operations in Poipet.------Donaco alleged the vendors had defied the non-compete clause and sought up to $US190m in damages.------But the company reached a settlement that it said was pragmatic and fair. Donaco has security of tenure over Star Vegas for the next 90 years.------Although the non-competition clauses will be removed from its contract, Donaco will receive $US38m in compensation. However, it will have to pay $US18m to settle claims made for unpaid management fees.------This settlement retires over 80 per cent of Donaco’s net current liabilities and preserves the Star Vegas business.------“This give us the stable platform we need to press forward on our other priorities for shareholders,” chairman Mel Ashton said.------Ashton said these priorities included improving Donaco’s financial position, weathering the impacts of the coronavirus and offering stability to third party vendors.------Shares jumped nearly 24 per cent to an intra-day peak of 8.3c this morning.------The post ------Corporate: Donaco settles legal case over Cambodian casino------ appeared first on ------Stockhead------.
