Lethwei is considered to be one of the most aggressive and brutal martial arts in the world, because the fighters fight bareknuckle with only the use of tape and gauze on their hands. The use of fists, elbows, knees, and feet, but more surprisingly, the head makes it a very unusual martial art. Although disallowed in many combat sports, the use of headbutt is an important of a Lethwei fighter’s arsenal. This is the reason it also known as “The Art of 9 Limbs”. ------WIKIPEDIA
