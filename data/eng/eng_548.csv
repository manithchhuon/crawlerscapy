You can exercise at home, even without equipment. Try to follow online videos, there’s a lot of resources for that.------Additionally, now you will have time to clean your home and do your chores, which is a good form of activity. Go for walks in nature, and try to sit less.------Get as much sunlight as you can, especially if you live in an area where there’s an opportunity to go out into nature. Go for walks, grab some fresh air, and expose yourself to sunlight.------Getting enough vitamins not just during the COVID-19 outbreak, but at all times, is crucial for a stronger immune system and mental wellbeing.------You might be instructed to do that, but prepare yourself properly. Make a working environment where you’ll be able to focus on your work. It might be hard to do that, especially if you have children to care for.------Try to keep them as busy as possible – make sure they do their homework and avoid other children. For employees working from home, read everything about your rights and ask the employer about the policies.------Now that we will have more time to spend, make sure you keep yourself busy. Do activities, clean your home, have a clear out, sort your computer files, photos, or anything that needs sorting.------Read books, magazines, articles, online material, solve puzzles or crosswords, watch shows or films, listen to podcasts. Anything that will keep your mind busy and your thoughts free of the coronavirus.------Open your windows, get out of the house and grab some fresh air. You can do the chores on your garden, or even look out your window more often to get a sense of space. Change rooms you’re in often.------Being informed about the coronavirus spread is helpful, although excessive worrying about it doesn’t help your mental health.------Especially if you watch the news or listen to the radio, where almost the only thing that’s talked about is the COVID-19 spread. Keep a balance between being informed and excessively following the news.------Too much information every day can become stressful. Check the news once or twice a day, which is more than enough to get the latest news.------Plus, limit your time you spend on social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter, where everyone shares their thoughts and feelings on the novel coronavirus.------If you’re recovering or suffering from substance abuse disorders, it’s crucial that you continue treatment despite the coronavirus outbreak.------You can get medication delivered to you or you can ask a relative or a friend to collect them for you.------People who suffer from substance abuse disorders are more susceptible to diseases and viruses, and that’s because of the failing immune system and ill-health that’s induced due to the disorder.------Another potential issue for substance abuse sufferers is that they can easily relapse now that they’re forced to stay at home.------Keep yourself busy throughout the day, and read the guidelines above. Stay strong.------[1] https://www.yalemedicine.org/stories/2019-novel-coronavirus/------[2] https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance
