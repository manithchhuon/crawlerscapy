Crime,FEATURED,Latest,Tourism;Ingólfur Steinar Ingólfsson------, an Icelandic traveler, was released from custody in Cambodia after spending two months in an immigration jail cell.------“I should have been free after a month, but they kept me in for an extra month because of the review on TripAdvisor,” says Ingólfur Steinar. He believes that the head of the institution (*in Siem Reap) where he had been in custody had kept him there for a longer time because of his relationship with the hotel that Ingólfur had stayed in the past.------Ingólfur was initially arrested because his visa had expired and he was said to have a debt account at the hotel where he had been staying. Ingólfur considered the hotel’s allegations to be based on misrepresentations and misconceptions and, in his custody, wrote a negative review of the hotel on TripAdvisor. Ingólfur believes that there is a connection between the hotel and the custody authorities, and he had been left inside for longer than needed out of revenge. ------DVICELAND
