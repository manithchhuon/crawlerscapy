FEATURED,Latest,Tourism;Comedians have rallied to the aid of a former colleague who has become stranded in Cambodia by coronavirus.------Tony Morewood was a fixture on the circuit in the 1980s and 1990s, last appearing at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2001 (where Chortle ------reviewed him------)------But 15 years ago he moved to South East Asia, where he has been working as a teacher – while taking the occasional stand-up gig.------However with Covid-19 closing schools until September, he has lost his income, and is struggling to get out of the country.------Comedian turned stand-up tutor ------Logan Murray------ has launched a ------crowdfunder------ to help, saying: ‘He can’t pay rent, is living very hand to mouth and finds himself trapped in a country that poverty won’t let him leave. ------‘We need to raise money for his late visa fees, a coronavirus test (the authorities are not letting any foreigners leave without one, but they are very hard for non-nationals to obtain) and a plane ticket back home. Until he gets a flight, he also needs money for food and shelter.’------Murray is trying to raise £2,000 via ------GoFundMe------ and already more than halfway there, thanks to 45 donors including comics including ------Simon Bligh------, ------Andy Smart------, ------Mark Hurst------ and ------JoJo Smith------. ------Dave Thompson------, the comic who also played Tellytubby Tinky Winky is the biggest single contributor, chipping in £140.------Morewood, 65, thanked supporters, writing: ‘It is truly heartening at the most difficult of times to have so many people immediately responding with donations, offers of help and good wishes.’------Describing himself as ‘broke’ and ‘totally alone’, he admits it will be ‘fiscally challenging’ getting back to England, where he no longer has any family.------Murray added: ‘Regardless of a contribution, please feel free to get in touch with Tony via ------FaceBook------. Any words from familiar faces would be very welcome.’ SOURCE: ------CHORTLE
